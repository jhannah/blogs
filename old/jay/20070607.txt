Roaming through Rooland - June 7

Tempting the wrath of my metered Internet connection I uploaded small versions of <a href="http://jays.net/ids/index.cgi?mode=album&album=./2007-Australia">a bunch of pictures</a> this morning. Everyone else is still sleeping so I can't post the pic from the top of the Sydney Harbour bridge with the Opera House in the background yet. Today is shark diving. I smothered myself in beet juice so 
I should be tasty. (They do burgers with beets down here apparently.) 
Wish us luck!
