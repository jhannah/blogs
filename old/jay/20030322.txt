Went to see Darby's band, miles on end @ the Music Box.  They rock. Buy their stuff!

I'm attempting a revival of the <a href="http://omaha.pm.org">Omaha Perl
Mongers</a>, having become their official group leader and all.
After <b>0</b> posts to the mailing list in 2002, it should be
pretty easy to stage a staggering comeback (relatively speaking). I was
suprised to find 
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/locale/us/ne/omaha">hundreds of Omaha 
Meetup groups</a>, some of them actually viable. -grin-

This weekend my truck is in the shop ($2300? wtf?) and Andria has strep 
throat. So, we're
both sitting at our separate homes talking about all the house hunting we're
not doing on this beautiful March weekend. Andria would like to encourage you
all to refrain from nervously chewing disease ridden pen caps at your 
local WalMart. Consumer Reports tells us that Super Target pen caps are OK.
<p>

I'm pleased to report that now that Andria is on medication, she no 
longer cringes and cries when she swallows.  We're both much happier.

<a href="http://zendo.org">Eli</a> has me all excited about races at
<a href="http://www.midamericamotorplex.com/">Mid America Motorplex</a>,
though I don't think he's going to get me out on the track any time
soon. My bike is one bolt and one jump start away from its first test
ride. Well, those and (3) a helmet that doesn't crush my skull, (4) a 
drivers license, (5) an inspection of my salvage title, (6) a title 
transfer, (7) insurance, (8) realllly big leathers, (9) chaps (maybe
I'd use 'em for the bike too), (10) a medical explanation of why my head
is so much bigger than it was in college that my helmet no longer fits, 
(11) nerves of steel, and (12) miscellaneous protective voodoo juju dolls
and such.

Work moved. I'm still employed. The world did not collapse as I feared.
Well, work did not collapse as I feared, anyway. The world is in a general
state of higgledy-piggledy. I wish our troops a safe and speedy return.
Especially <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~bova/">Martin</a>: pilot,
philosopher, ethicist, friend. I feel a lot better about the use of force
knowing our might is built on good people like him. For my small part, I'm
again shooting for 10% net income to charity. 
I'm hopeful my tax and 
<a href="http://www.mercycorps.com">Mercy Corps</a> dollars are aiding
the greater good.
