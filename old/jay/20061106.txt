Triglycerides for everybody!

This year my annual physical resulted in my first prescription medication
for general decrepitness. Everything else looks good, but
my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride">triglycerides</a>
were so high the doctor told me to start taking 500mg of Niacin (over the counter)
every day to see if that brings them down. <p>

On the way back to work it occurred to me that while I had skipped breakfast as demanded by the blood
tests I had been drinking coffee (black) all morning. I called and they said that could have thrown 
off the tests, so I made a new appointment.<p>

A week later, having consumed <b>nothing</b> but water for 10 hours I once again got my blood drawn.
I joked with the nurse "watch, it'll be even worse." 
Bingo. 275. Now Niacin isn't strong enough -- the doctor puts me on 145mg Tricor tablets. Prescription
strength, baby.
<p>

Mom says she had the same problem, started eating 2 (4?) tablespoons of Flax seed every day, and it 
went away. So on top of Tricor and the Men's Health Andria "suggested" I take every day I'm doing 3
capsules of flax seed oil. 
<p>

It's official. I'm old. (I sure ain't 30 anymore. Apparently 31 is when the meds start.)
Just ask TransUnion, one of the 3 major credit agencies. They list my birth date in 
Feb, 1923. Yup, I'm 83. No wonder I get all that retirement home junk mail.
