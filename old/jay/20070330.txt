Too many toys
So why are there a billion news aggregator gizmos and I'm still
not happy?
<a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a> botches dates,
<a href="http://newshutch.com/">Newshutch</a> doesn't merge feeds,
<a href="http://blogrolling.com">BlogRolling</a> doesn't sort by most recent.
OPML - yet another markup language.
<p>
I guess I'm waiting for "Web 3.0" so I can be cool again.
