Hey, I sued Qwest! Who knew?
<a href="http://qwestfiberopticclassaction.com/">Check it out.</a>
I got a letter in the mail today informing me 
that by default I'm a member of a class action lawsuit against Qwest because
our house backs up to a railroad track where "beginning in the 1990s" Qwest
ran fiber optic cable.
<p>
Seems a touch silly, 'cause 
(1) I didn't own the land when they laid it.
(2) It was USWest or predecessor back then, not Qwest (right?).
(3) How could it possibly harm me for them to lay that fiber anyway. It was
definately the railroad's land, not mine.
(4) I don't like lawyers/judges assuming that I want to sue somebody. 
Yup, I have to <b>opt OUT</b> of suing Qwest. 
It's like spam, only with lawyers and judges. 
If they had sent me an email without me <b>opting IN</b> they would have 
been breaking spam laws, but they can add me to lawsuits all day long and I 
have to <b>opt OUT</b>? Uhhh... what?
<p>
I'm opting out. If I'm screwing myself out of millions I'm gonna be pissed.
