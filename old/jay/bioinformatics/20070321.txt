Biogeekery

I'm at the 2007 Nebraska Research and Innovation Conference listening to
<a href="http://www.systemsbiology.org/Scientists_and_Research/Faculty_Groups/Hood_Group/Profile">Leroy Hood</a>'s
keynote. Leroy is a genetics+business deity. <p>
As I strive for this career it is both
reassuring a scary to hear that his first 19 attempts to commercialize biological 
systems failed. Then he went on to invent the automated sequencing machine,
found billion dollar companys, win awards, etc.
<p>
Jay the egomaniac says: "If Leroy can do it, so can I." I'm not dead yet. -grin-
<p>
Random notes from his talk:
<ul>
<li>P4 medicine is coming: Predictive, Preventive, Personalized, Participatory.
<li>In 10 years a handheld device will take a drop of blood and perform 2500 protein
tests which will tell us the status of the organs in the body, which generate signature
proteins that come only from specific organs.
<li>Biology/Medicine drives Technology, which revolutionizes Biology/Medicine.
</ul>
