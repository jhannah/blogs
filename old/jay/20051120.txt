PODcasts, business cards, websites, genomes, wet dogs, etc.

<li>My first, of two, dentist appts was fun. The left half of my mouth is 
georgeous again. Tuesday I get several more shots in the right half of 
my mouth. Then I'm sure to feel 50% prettier still!
<li>We rolled out the new <a href="http://www.omnihotels.com">Omni Hotels 
website</a>. That was a lot of work.
<li>I got our 
<a href="http://omaha.pm.org/kwiki/?BusinessCards">Omaha Perl Mongers 
business cards</a> proof. Rock on!
<li>On our walk this morning, listening to podcasts on my iPod shuffle,
Tipper decided to try and drown herself again. I yanked her out by her harness
and she promptly drenched her rescuer. -laugh-
<li>Podcasts rule. I heard on the This Week in Tech podcast that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">captchas</a>
like the Kwiki::Scode I installed on the Omaha.pm wiki are the bane of blind
people. Doh! To stop spammers I've blocked the blind too? -sigh- I 
just subscribed to <a href="http://podcacher.com/">PodCacher</a>, the podcast
about GeoCaching. Maybe I'll break down and buy a GPS soon?
<li>I've been welcomed into the <a href="http://bioperl.org/">Bioperl</a>
community. Perhaps I can help write software that will someday help/save lives?
