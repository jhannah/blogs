Evildoers and Gooddoers. I'm the decider.
(Yes, President Bush amazes me.)

Wow. Got my first-ever ASCII art spam a few weeks ago. 
Unreal. I need to stop stopping about spammers now
or I'll get all fired up again. Frank recommends

Kenn sent me an awesome article on

Dad and I are on the cusp of healthy dialogue about the writings of Sam Harris. You can watch a video
of Sam at the <a href="http://beyondbelief2006.org/Watch/">Beyond Belief website</a>.
Dad also sent me the <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0609-27.htm">CNN interview</a>
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Berg">Michael Berg</a> who's son Nick was
decapitated in Iraq. I struggle to understand Michael's pacifism. Not that I can embrace 
<a href="http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/cox/040517">the opposite argument</a>.
I can't vouch for either mindset. So where does that leave me?

Still running the Omaha Perl Mongers. You can find me on that  mailing list. 
I'm still the defacto lead ticket
monkey of the International Perl Mongers. Kiran and I are BioPerling most weekends. Our
Project OpenLab will hopefully go public soon. Trying to burn microarrays for Staph.

Cousin Kandi sent me <a href="http://mysthillarium.com/anthology/windows.htm">this</a>. 
My favorite part is the quote at the bottom: "A clean house is a sign of a broken computer."

Next time you're in Orange County, swing by <a href="http://www.inkamamas.com/house_special_dishes.html">Inka Mamas</a>, my favorite Peruvian restaurant in the whole world. :)  I wonder if Peruvian food
is even better in Peru? -drool-

Note to self: Andria's favorite song is "She's Got a Way" by Billy Joel.

Chris Payne moved <a href="http://music.podshow.com/music/listeners/searchResults.php?SearchString=chris+payne&go2=Search+Keywords">his music</a>. Surface Mount Technology rules.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealand">Sealand</a> rules. If only I had my own
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunsell_Forts">Maunsell Fort</a> I'd have my own country
too. How cool would that be?
... Huh. I guess I don't need one. Stephen <a href="http://www.seafort.org/menu.html">did it
for me</a>. Read that blog and <b>you</b> won't need one anymore either.  :)

I've been YouTube'd by Dad (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4B-r8KJhlE">Strongest
Dad in the World</a>) and Todd (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEzGIuY7kw">Straight
Outta Lynwood</a>). Both awesome for completely different reasons.
