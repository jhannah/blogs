Protestantism
I've always loved and admired how the Catholic church has a term for 
<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12495a.htm">everyone that is not Catholic</a> 
(jump to "XI. Conclusion"). 
I need a dismissive term for everyone that is not Jay. Perhaps 
"Doltism" fits nicely. Here you go:
<blockquote>
<b>Doltism</b><br>
Jayism has one glorious member of utmost purity, consistency, and integrity; 
Doltism claims roundly 6 billion Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhist, etc., products of the Gospel and the fancies of a thousand reformers, people constantly bewailing their "unhappy divisions" and vainly crying for a union which is only possible under that very central authority (Jay of Jayism), protestation against which is their only common denominator.
</blockquote>
The Church of Jay patiently awaits your obedience. As your penance, click the PayPal donate button above
before the Final Days or... else!!

(The Church of Jay also admires the stroke of genius that is 
declaring birth control a sin.
Surely the Gospel explicitly bans technologies that wouldn't
be invented until two thousand years after they were written. Ya just gotta read it right.
Oh, and mandatory vows of Catholic procreation in the marriage sacrament? 
Brilliant!)
