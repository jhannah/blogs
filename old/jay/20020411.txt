N'awlens!
Here's the <a href="/albums/200203-Nawlens/">photo album of our trip to N'Awlens</a> I've been hinting at for weeks.

I'm running lights for 
<a href="http://www.shelterbelt.org/season2002_loveisstrange.shtml">Love
is Strange</a> which previews tonight and opens tomorrow. This is not the 
mostly campy, silly, fun kind of show I'm used to doing at the 'Belt. I've 
never worked a serious play before. It's amazing. You should see it.
