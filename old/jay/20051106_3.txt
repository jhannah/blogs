The MDs are picking on me.
2 weeks ago Andria and I started a diet plan: 
<a href="http://www.seattlesutton.com/home.asp">Seattle Sutton</a>. We're
slowly acclimating to 1200 and 2000 calorie diets, respectively. 
Then, just for fun, my dentist thinks it would be a blast to replace 5
of the 9 fillings I got 3 years ago. So, two appointments and several shots
in the mouth later I'll be back where I started...? Oh, plus she's recommending
I get my 4 wisdom teeth yanked.
Oh, and my home sleep study says my oxidation level is dropping off as low as 73%.
I guess that's bad, so now I have an appointment to check into the hospital for an
overnight sleep study.

So if this is 30, what will 50 look like?
