Our thanks go out to Josh Kleensang Enterprises (modeling, web hosting, and bestiality divisions) for our fab-tastic new jays.net logo! 

We'd also like to thank Josh
for pointing out that Valentine's Day themes get really old by February 15th
and induce vomiting once March hits. We feel much better now that we've shed
the vestiges of interpersonal cuteness for the safe haven of goofy pictures
of friends stealing waterfowl.
One last V-Day note, then I'll quit (honest): Don posted

From Shelterbelt With Love photos</a> if you're interested.

<b>Hedonism alert!!</b> Andria and I are off to N'awlens, Weezianna 
for the last week of 
March! Yee-ha! Jay's full week of zero work since '95. Place your seafood
and bead orders now, we'll do our darndest.

<b>Misc nerd: (1)</b> I posted a couple of BRAD's papers he wrote in 
college in my newly christened
<a href="/unpub/toc.shtml">Jay's Unpublished Stuff</a> area. They're a fun
read. 
<b>(2)</b> I wrote a 
<a href="/dnsbl.txt">spam filter</a> since the current
jays.net sendmail admin has been slacking off his crack-down-on-spam duties. 
I get what I pay for, I guess. (Just kidding, Josh! Nice penguin! -grin-). 
I had no flippin' idea that there were
<a href="http://www.declude.com/JunkMail/Support/ip4r.htm">55 DNS-based 
blacklists</a> up and running! You can even 
<a href="http://samspade.org/t/rbl">scan them</a> to
find out what lists any given spammer is on! Wow! Back in my day (1997) 
MAPS was the only game in town. Now it's a big, crazy spam-blocking party
out there! 
<b>(3)</b> A couple guys from corporate are installing big, wacky
terminal servers at work this/next week, and then the boss man 
is coming down for a visit/update.
<p>

Andria and I are going to see <a href="http://www.snapproductions.com/snap_frame.html">Splendora</a> tonight.
