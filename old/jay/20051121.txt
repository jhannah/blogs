Dreaming and puking
This morning Zach had just sit down at the breakfast table when I came 
downstairs. "How'd you sleep last night?" I asked. "Fine." "Did you have
any dreams?" "Ya." "Really? What dream did you have?"
<p>
Silence, then a splattering sound. I turn around and Zach's losing his 
breakfast even though he hasn't eaten any yet. I rush over beside him,
holding his shoulder and comforting him. 
<p>
Was his dream <b>that bad</b>? -laugh-
<p>
Later I got him to recount the dream: 
"First me and my friends and you and mom were down in the sea and we
were stuck in a cage and there was a cage on top of us in the air and
there was a plane towards the cage up in the air like a hundred miles
and ummm and mom brought my bull whip so I could flip it up there and 
I tried to climb it and I couldn't cause the whip was too short to climb
and then we shoulda just walked up the shore."
<p>
"Howd we get out of the cage?"
<p>
"I whipped my bullwhip up there but it didnt reach the other cage but 
then we just walked to a different spot and the cage fell down and 
everyone got out of the cage down in the sea and we just got out of the 
spot and walked up to the shore. It was scary."
<p>
The cages under the sea come from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, which
we just saw on Sunday. The bullwhip is Indiana Jones. I have no idea where
the plane came from. -ed.
