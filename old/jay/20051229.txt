Xmas joys

Santa was way too generous to me this year, and/or I was way to stingy to 
Andria.
Her two were big ticket items, but I got something like 10 presents (stocking
stuffers to big stuff) so my guilt gland is pumping overtime, but I don't
know what to do about it. Holidays certainly can be
double edged stress machines, eh? Got a sweet watch, which the commercials
tell me is what makes a man, so I guess I'm a sweet man now. er... something
like that.

<p>Zach got a guitar and amp, so we're going to take lessons together. He's
also starting Sylvan learning center, 4 hours a week focused on his reading
skills. They <b>guarantee</b> they can catch up a 
year of schooling every 37 hours of 
tutoring. They say the difference is the one-on-one attention vs 30 kids 
in a class... Quite a claim, eh? I'm a Canadian, eh?

<P>Took up <a href="http://www.geocaching.com">GeoCaching</a> thanks to my
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003WGP5/104-2519197-9772731?n=699272&s=electronics&v=glance">Xmas GPS receiver</a>. Got 10 
caches already. I'm hooked. Yup, its my new hobby of the week -- I'm turning
into Eli circa 2002.

<p>Got an email from martin(at)jays(dot)se this morning. Dude in Sweden asking
about buying jays.net from me. Small world, eh? Dis Kanook thinks so.
