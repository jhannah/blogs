27 electrodes on me
Captain's log. Star date: 28th November, 2005, 20:40. I'm sitting in my room in Midlands Hospital in Papillion, NE, waiting for the tech (doctor?) to hook me up to a bunch of machines. I'm here for a sleep study, you see, during which they will try to determine why I reportedly stop breathing at night. Sleep apnea, they call it. Well, they don't call it that yet, but come 6am tomorrow morning perhaps they'll be calling it that.
<p>
Perhaps this is just Andria playing a trick on me and small sliver of the Nebraskan medical community? After all, I don't feel like someone that would stop breathing at night. Sounds silly. Why would I do that? Denial is my friend.
<p>
The camera and infrared lamp mounted ominously above the bed might disagree with my self assessment. It's lights out in a couple hours and a pleasant young man named Samuel is duty bound to monitor my every twitch. 20 minutes ago he left me watching an informative video on a rollaway cart, and wandered off to "hook up the other guy." He promised he'd be back in 45 minutes or so, and I simply can't wait.
<p>
According to the video I'll have 4 electrode thingies on my scalp, a hearbeat thing on my chest, 2 frilly expansion things around my chest and belly to measure expansion or lack thereof, 2 more electrodes on my calf for something unintelligible (the VHS fuzzed out a bit during that part), and some gizmo mounted on my upper lip to measure air flow speeds. A regular Inspector Gadget I'll be.
<p>
A couple hours after I fall asleep he should know whether or not a CPAP is something we should try. A CPAP is this pump thingie that goes over your nose to push minor air pressure into my nasal channel to keep my airway from collapsing. hmmmmm.... Not a big fan of this thing already. Luckily all the folks on the video enthusiastically recommend it, so I'm convinced.

What a surreal experience. I'd give $50 for a picture of those 27 (yes, literally 27) electrodes all over me. Its hard to sleep w/ probes up your nose. I had nightmares which freaked me out since I only remember dreams once a year or so. In 2 weeks I should have the official results of
the sleep study in hand... gak.
