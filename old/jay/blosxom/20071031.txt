Senator Hagel's office called me
Holy crap. Eric from <a href="http://hagel.senate.gov/">Senator Hagel</a>'s 
office called me. From the 202 area code. That's Washington D.C. 
Eric didn't have much to say except that they had received
my email (form letter) regarding 
<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:HR02826:">HR2826</a> 
and would take my thoughts into consideration. HR2826 is not up for a vote yet
and Eric didn't know how the senator might vote.  (... huh? do Senators
vote on house resolutions? don't representatives do that? ...)
<p>
Still, I'm stunned that they (1) read my email, (2) cared, (3) called me, 
and (4) I actually got through to Eric and talked to him when 
I called him back. ...  Maybe the system can work? ... Wow ... Stunned.

Where do you stand? Where can I go in Omaha to talk to people about this?
