Greetings from TX!

Down in Dallas sitting in my boss' house while he runs the kid around before dinner w/ the boss and 
my bosss' boss. :) My laptop and an Internet connection, that's all I need to entertain myself 
for a day or
a month. Just roll me over every once in a while so I don't get bed sores, and shoo the rats away
every once in a while and I'm golden.

<p>Zach was rollerblading last Thr and fell and broke his right arm. If you're keeping score, that's 
2 breaks for the left arm and 1 for the right, and he's only 8 years old. His new motto
is "I do my own stunts!" which is now written on his cast and mom found some boxer shorts w/ that
logo on it. Funniest thing I've heard in a long time. :) That'll be the new jays.net logo once
I get back home. Should be a good one.

<p>I'm going to see if I can drop
