Another mid-life crisis!
I bought a <a href="/sv650/motorcycle.html">motorcycle on 
eBay</a>! Can you believe that? Should show up here next week. Oooo, baby!
-grin- 
It motivated me to semi-organize my garage for the first time. Ever. The
house is 3 years old now. The pile of crap in the middle of 
my garage was an undisturbed time capsule of the day I moved in until last
weekend. I bought shelving and everything. Wow. Must be
motorcycle nesting instincts rooted deep in my Y chromosome.

<b>Photographic evidence</b> of my continued 
<a href="/theatre/">thespianism</a> 
(2002-<a href="/ids/">Camelot and
Shelterskelter7</a>) and our roadtrip to Kansas City for
<a href="/ids">Thanksgiving</a>.
I think I'm starting to kick the
hundreds of photos per hour habit. -grin- 
We went and saw <i>Beyond Therapy</i> at Baby D productions on Sunday.
It was great. Thanks for the invite, Coyle!<p>

<b>Work!</b> We're moving! The reservation center is moving a mile north
next February. Yikes. Highlights of work nowadays include diddling with
OOPy Perl, SOAP, and .NET (VB.NET and PerlNet). Segueless, I'll now
mention that the Justin formerly known
as "Intern" has authored a web log [he took it down! boo! -ed] from 
Taiwan, including many culinary inputs and outputs. Highly recommended
reading.
<p>

<b>Rant!</b> After pitching in at the Open Door Mission over Thanksgiving,
I seriously considered ranting on and on about my observations regarding
racial and fiscal profiling, charity abuse and what we should
do about it, etc. etc. Thanks to my laziness, you've all been spared.
(All 4 of you that read jays.net, that is.)
<p>
Happy holidays to all!
