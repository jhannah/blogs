2003?? Is that digit a three? Oy! 
My 10 year high school reunion 
is in a couple weeks. I'll be 28 this August. I just got off the phone w/ 
a college kid who kept referring to me as "alumni." 
I am not getting old. I am not getting old.
<p>
To prove that I am not getting old, I have <a href="/ids/">photos of my
motorcycle</a> (click "2002-sv650") which arrived recently. I had to have 
it welded at a local shop, and just got it back a couple days ago.
Would an old guy have a bike like that? I think not. -grin-

jays.net is holding it's 1st <a href="/shiite.html">auction of misplaced
junk</a>. Bid high and big often!

A very sweaty Harlem Globetrotter sat on Andria while doing 
his shtick. Click 2 minutes off her 15 minutes of fame!
Work is scary. 6 weeks until we're homeless and the new building is far
from ready.
