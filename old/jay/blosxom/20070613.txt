Torango Zoo and Mowbray Park Farmstay

<a href="http://jays.net/ids/index.cgi?mode=album&album=./2007-Australia">400 more photos!</a>  I warned you Dad has a happy trigger finger, didn't I?
Back in Sydney for a few hours before our 7am flight tomorrow. Flying to 
Brisbane, right on schedule! :)  
<p>
Torango Zoo is the most beautiful zoo I've
ever seen. We saw the free flight bird show. Amazing. 
It's hard to beat birds swooping
mere inches overhead on a gorgeous day with a stunning view of the harbor,
the city shining on the other side (opera house, bridge), sailing ships,
perfect sunset. If you want a city lifestyle you should 
give Sydney a try.
<p>
Got a private tour by volunteers at the zoo. Took a great 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echidna">echidna</a>-cam video. It 
joins the shark and fruit bat videos I'm bringing back to the states.
The notorious BRAD has decided that the koala is the most boring animal in
creation (err... evolution?). It sleeps 20 hours and day and isn't terribly
fascinating when awake. We all got to pet a kangaroo or two while feeding 
them "browse", what they kept calling these apparently delicious flowers 
we kept feeding them.

I think everybody's waiting for me again, so gotta run. No Geocaching
luck so far. These American travelbugs are getting awfully heavy. -sigh-
