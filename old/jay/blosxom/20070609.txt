The James Craig - June 8

<a href="http://jays.net/ids/index.cgi?mode=album&album=./2007-Australia">More photos</a>: I noticed all the pics I uploaded yesterday are pretty small, so
I uploaded some large versions of the shark dive from the divers camera.
They start on page 4 -- files named DSC*. I also
uploaded a large version of the bridge climb. It's the very first photo in 
the album now.

Yesterday we visited the Australian Maritime Museum for a tour
of the <a href="http://www.australianheritagefleet.com.au/JCraig/JCraig.html">James Craig</a>, the ship that Harlan Hall (my uncle in law) spent so
much time fundraising for restoration. It takes 35 sailors to operate her 
many sails (or 2 to operate her diesel engine -laugh-). I uploaded some big
photos into the link above. They start on page 3.
