Sam Harris
An email exchange between my father and I. I do believe
it's a keeper.

Hey guys --<br>
<br>
Here's some material I'd love to get your thoughts on:

Control-Click on the first "watch" link. Choose "Save Link As...". Save the file to your Desktop or somewhere. It's huge (250MB) so it will take quite a while to download.
<p>
Once downloaded open it, and fast-forward 52 minutes in. Sam Harris talks for 21 minutes. Most of this stuff is from his book:

I'm curious what your thoughts are.

We took a look at the Sam Harris clip...at least until
your Mom fell asleep.  :  ) It merits a more lengthy
reply that maybe we could explore in person or on the
phone, but here are some of my first blush thoughts:
<p>
a) I agree that dogmatism is dangerous, and his
example of the Iraqi war as an expression of clashing
religious ideologies is a good case in point. The US
neocons of the Religious Right who welcome conflict in
the Middle East as a necessary precursor to the end
times and the return of Christ are to me just as scary
as the Muslim jihadists who celebrate martyrdom and
anticipate virgins in heaven as a reward for wreaking
murder and mayhem here on earth. I think it needs to
be said, however, that in both cases these are
excesses of the fringe that do not represent the
middle ground of the faiths they have co-opted for
their own purposes. I don't think that Jesus or
Muhammad either one would recognize or endorse the
fringe of the faith movements begun in their names,
despite these groups' representation of themselves as
the "true" remnant.
<p>
2) While I do think we would be better off with less
dogmatism, I can't agree with Harris that we would be
better off without religion. Yes, Christianity, for
instance, has given us Crusades and Inquisitions, but
it also has given us social reforms to abolish child
labor, eliminate slavery, reform mental health
institutes, build hospitals, feed the poor, etc. I
would stand by something I wrote to you once before,
that while religion may not be strictly rational, in
the sense a scientist seeks, but it is not thereby
irrational. It seems to me it says that what is "real"
or "true" in the human  experience is not just
measured by intellect or ration, but equally by
intuition, emotion, mysticism, stories, etc. So when
Harris says religion is based on "bad evidence," i
have to ask what his criteria of "good evidence" might
be. If it is only Western scientific method, I think
it overlooks evidence of much greater depth contained
in ancient religious traditions and "myths."
<p>
3. I agree with Harris that a temptation of religion
is to divorce itself from all tests of reality, e.g.
his instance of an ideology opposing birth control
that thereby opposes use of condomss even in the
African culture where millions will die from such
ignorant dogma. I think the corollary is a science
that divorces itself from the realities of faith,
rejecting the testimony of thousands through the ages
whose lives have been transformed by experiences with
divinity. Are these experiences not "real" simply
because they cannot be replicated in a laboratory?
<p>
4. I appreciated Harris' opening point that science is
not necessarily the enemy of either morality nor
mystery, despite what some fundamentalists may teach
about the dangers of "godless secularism." I'm one of
those described by the final lecturer who chooses to
say that there is no necessary conflict between
science and religion, e.g. accepting that a creator
God could accomplish creation through the process of
evolution rather than seven literal days. Don't press
me too far, however, to explain just how the Creator
is related to creation, since I'm still trying to
figure out, for instance, where I stop and God begins,
or vice versa.
<p>
Well, anyway, there's some grist for the mill--not
very finely ground, but still something I keep chewing
on.
<p>
Be most excellent to your most excellent self!

Thanks for your thoughts. We'll have to talk through some of it when next we meet.

Sam is an interesting man. He seems to be calling rationalists to action, but then has no action to prescribe. Read:

I don't understand how a man with such apparently strong convictions doesn't have any recommendations for people to consider. There are, however, a thousand people who have posted to his forum w/ ideas. Some crazy, some reasonable I assume.
