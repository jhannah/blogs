Meds update
Went back for my 30 day check-up on my cholesterol and it was a lot better. But not better enough -- now the doc
has me on 145mg Tricor and 10mg Zetia daily. "Come back in 6 to 8 weeks." -sigh-  
I wonder if I can still do my quarterly apheresis ("blood") donation? I emailed the query to the Red Cross.

Any minute now Dad is going to get his 
<a href="http://brotherbemused.blogspot.com/">Brother Bemused Blog</a> and 
<a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GCZZGF&Submit6=Go">Zach Jones' Dead Man's Chest geocache</a>
up and running.

Huh... Somehow I'm now $128.11 in the black on the <a href="http://omaha.pm.org/shirts.shtml">2006 Perl Mongers 
t-shirt order</a>. 400 t-shirts ($4,209.45 USD after S&H), 28 groups in 7 countries. I actually <b>made</b> money? 
I donated the extra funds to The Perl Foundation.
