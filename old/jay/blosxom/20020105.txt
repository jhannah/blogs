Sweet! Hadn't really gotten much onto this website yet and the pic to the right is already out of date, as predicted.
As you can tell, the jays.net
webmaster needs a stern talking to.

2002. Wow... 5th year living in Omaha, 3rd year on the same job, 14th month
in a relationship and all going strong. <b>All records.</b> As Andria
will attest, I think too much and I have some weird nomad genetics which 
tune to any distant siren's song. Growing up I never lived in the same place
more than 5 years. I'm not big on the concept of "normal" when it comes to
psychology/sociology, but I can't imagine living in Omaha 10 years from now.
There's so much to see and do before the ride is over, ya know? On the other
hand it's a great life I've got <i>here</i>... 
This "pursuit of happiness" thing needs an operators manual...

Wed (Thr?) I was at work talking to my boss in Dallas (minding my 
own business and/or the business I was about to be directed to mind by
the man who signs my paychecks) when my mobile phone rang. 
This part was not terribly surprising, 
since my mobile phone tends to ring. The surprising bit* begins now.
My mobile phone has caller ID. My mobile phone's caller ID said that someone
was calling me from my house. I live alone. My girlfriend is still at work.
I'm still at work. Yet someone is calling my mobile phone 
<i>from my house</i>...
<p>

I tried to imagine who it could be and how they could possibly have
good news for me, but quickly ran out of ideas. 
Was a burglar calling to confess? If so, how did s/he get my mobile phone 
number? Was a firefighter calling to tell me that most of my house burned
down but they miraculously saved the $5 phone in my kitchen? 
If so, how did <i>s/he</i> get my mobile phone number?
<p>

Curious, I pushed the "talk" button and said "hello?" (This is a
customary greeting in the region where I live, though the person presenting
the greeting doesn't usually sound so hesitant.) The voice in my phone
said "hello." Then the voice continued to speak and it became clear that
the voice was my brother <a href="/brad/">BRAD</a> explaining that he no
longer lives in Illinois, he lives in my basement. Effective immediately.
<p>

"... Oh." I said. I paused. "Well then... welcome to Omaha." We agreed to 
talk later because he said he would probably still be at my house that
evening. We hung up and I went back to talking to my boss. I explained
the situation to my boss who was preplexed and amused that Nebraska has such
a liberal squater's bill of rights. My brother has left again, reportedly
for Sioux City to visit friends. I asked when he'd be back. He didn't know.
I asked if he would be back on Monday. He said "probably not." 
Confident in my encyclopedic knowledge that
my brother would "probably not" be back on Monday
but would probably return at some point to claim his stuff which is now 
stacked in my basement, we parted ways and I went home to my new found
no-sleep-till-3am Rollercoaster Tycoon addiction.
<p>

That was the long way of telling you that my brother lives here too now. 
It should also be noted, for the record, that the Justin
formerly known as Intern will be moving in next week staying with me
through August.

* I am not British, but I have been watching the movie Snatch over and 
over again. Excellent flick. Highly recommended by 1 out of 1 jays.net 
employees.
<p>

BTW, I'm off to Dallas on Monday for 3 days of meetings to see what 
efficiencies
my department may be able to bring to Operations at the corporate office.
Wish me luck, but not too much luck, as I'd rather not come home with 5 
more years of work stacked on our project list. -grin-
