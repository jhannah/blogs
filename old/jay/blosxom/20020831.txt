Andria, Zach, and I went to Michigan last month.
We brought back
<a href="/ids/index.cgi">225 photos of the 
Hannah/Monson/Brombaugh/etc reunion</a>. It was great! Thanks for hosting
us Lynn and Marcia!!

The Justin formerly known as "Intern" has left. Again. He's off to Taiwan
this time, but we managed to <a href="/ids/index.cgi">get some photos</a>
before he left.

I've been <b>cast in my first musical</b>! <i>eek!</i> I'm Sir Sagramore in
<a href="http://hometown.aol.com/bellelittle/">Bellevue Little Theatre</a>'s
production of Camelot! Come on down to Bellevue and cheer/boo me -- 
the show runs the last 3 weekends of September.
<p>
<b>Nerd alert:</b> This latest photo album is done in IDS, an slick little
albuming software which integrates to Shutterfly, letting you order prints 
online! How nerdy is that? It does full dynamic image resizing junk w/ Perl
and lets users post their own comments, change themes, etc...
