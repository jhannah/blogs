Family Ties
My <a href="http://jays.net/genealogy/Html/I0074.html">1st cousin Ben</a>
took me out skeet shooting yesterday. I've never fired shotguns before...
Sweeeet. He has guns passed down from his grandfathers. Too cool.
Got an email out of the blue from my 
<a href="http://jays.net/genealogy/Html/I723.html">4th cousin Seth</a>
whom I didn't know existed.  
He's helped me piece together quite
a few new ties in my genealogy database already, and promises more to come.
He found my genealogy page doing an Internet search, otherwise we probably
never would have "met". Isn't the Internet slick?

Still don't have a photo of Zach's cast collection. Next Wed we go back to
the orthepedic again for yet another set of x-rays to make sure the bone is
within acceptable tolerances on the screwed up scale. When he first broke it
the xrays didn't look so bad, but now the muscles have pulled the bones around
and the xrays are scary. The doc says its still good enough though -- so here's
hoping he doesn't have to re-break it! ack!
Zach's getting some extra help at Sylvan learning center over the last
few weeks. Looks encouraging! We've got our first parent review thing coming
up next week, so that'll be an interesting report.

The <a href="http://omaha.pm.org">Omaha Perl Mongers</a> are doing a bunch
of genetics stuff lately. We have 2 biology genius types on the roles now.
Too cool. I need more free time!

I have 55 points in <a href="http://www.geocaching.com">Geocaching</a> now.
Moved a <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/track/details.aspx?guid=11c48c71-2444-40b3-8e30-1d7f7228036d">travel bug named Marreta</a> yesterday, which started
its journeys in Portugal. It's in <a href="http://travelbugrace.geocaching-pt.net/">a race</a> right now and its winning! Yay!
