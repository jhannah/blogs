Ouch! ... and some good stuff. :)

<a href="http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=memy&sid=0&o_symb=memy&freq=7&time=18">MEMY stock</a> took a 50% dive on Monday on 
news that one of its 2 drugs in Phase IIa trials failed. Whoops! Anyone
want to buy mine at $2.17?

We discovered that at least part of our house has no house wrap under the
siding and our builder isn't returning my calls. I could end up in my 
first lawsuit over this since we could be looking at $20K.

Zach took up skateboarding 3 weeks ago. He's taking lessons at the skate
park every Sunday morning @ 9am from a homeless-looking ex-pro. (He's
a great teacher.) After two rounds of that I got so insanely
bored that I went out and bought my own board w/ neon-yellow grip tape. 
So now my 335' ass + helmet +
knee + elbow + wrist guards and Zach are "shredding" it up. At work Trey
reminded me that <i>force = mass * velocity</i>, so I'm doomed. Stupid
physics. ... On the other hand I took 6 runs down the volcano on Sunday 
and I'm not dead yet!  -grin-

Andria bought a new super-sporty black Honda Civic SI a few weeks back. 
She was pretty excited about it. Still is? She stopped washing
it every weekend. Does that mean anything?
<P>
We're heading to <a href="http://scratchpad.wikia.com/wiki/2007_SD_Vacation">South Dakota</a> for a long weekend next weekend, and then 
I'm heading to NY Nov 1-7 for a <a href="http://scratchpad.wikia.com/wiki/2007_CSHL">couple BioNerd conferences</a>. I'm pretty pumped up about it.
Annual physical yesterday, and the doc's pretty happy. Apparently
my cup-peeing skills are still adequate. 
I'm still on Zetia and Tricor for cholesterol. 
My first mid-term in 12 years is tonight. Wish me luck.  :)
