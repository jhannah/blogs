It's gotten a lot better already, but boy was that nasty.

Free engraving too. Cool.

Milestone: It occurred to me to take a life snapshot last week:
I've lost 45 lbs. I was wearing my new jeans (8 inch waist shrinkage),
belt, shoes, shirt, and shwanky sport jacket, wedding ring,
catching another flight to Dallas looking all corporate; 
this time to appear as a panelist (OTA Interopability). Apparently
I'm an expert in my field now, and people pay hundreds of dollars to 
attend a conference -- and I'm one of the people <b>speaking</b>?
30 years old and in a lot of ways I guess my hospitality career
has already peaked? Save working for a bigger company, I'm not sure
what's left. :) At home my wife, son, one pair of hounds, and toad await
my return from the road. I guess I'm all grown up.

That same day I was picking up my wedding ring and had an experience. 
We had been in Lincoln a couple weekends ago looking at bands and trying 
them on at different sizes and widths. Decided a size 10, width 10 was the
best fit and coolest looking, so that's what we mail ordered: tight enough
not to fall off accidentally, but not too tight to remove w/ a little effort.
On delivery day, I went to the
USPS depot, picked up the box, opened it up -- cool ring! Slid it on my finger,
it bumped hard over my knuckle and thumped down onto the base of my finger. 
(Did I actually <i>hear</i> the thump?) 
Wow. Tight. Very tight. 
Somehow "the real thing" is much tighter then the trials at the 
store. I can't even get the thing off to show Andria the engraving inside!
I sat in my truck, laughing at the analogy. A cliche? Absolutely. 
But a powerful one, when its <i>your</i> finger. :) 
Nope, that thing isn't coming off.
