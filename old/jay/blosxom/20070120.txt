How To Transfer a Domain

A = Jay, B = "Admin", C = old registrar, D = new registrar, E = registry
<p>
1. A notifies D of intent to transfer, pays $<br>
2. D asks B for approval<br>
3. B approves (to D via A)<br>
4. D asks A for auth code. A asks C, C asks E<br>
5. C unlocks domain<br>
6. auth codes flow from E to C to A to D<br>
7. D notifies E of intent to transfer<br>
8. E asks C for approval<br>
9. C approves or ignores E<br>
10. E tells D transfer is OK<br>
11. D tells E it is now authoritative, tells A<br>
12. A drinks beer<br>
<p>

Easy, huh? Now we just have to get all that done 130 times with no
downtime or production impact.

Received this IM earlier this week:
<blockquote>
(14:27:24) sgomni: i want to know if i should work through UC in type B
and HK, IG and ET responses telling TA to end TTY with you or Sean...
</blockquote>

Note to retired self in the year 2040: Remember that? That's what you did for a living.

Prucha sent me the story of 
<a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Fisher_Price_Technology_Integration.aspx">the
vibrating child seat that runs reports</a>. Sounds like PC AnyWhere at Omni. -shudder-
Trying to research Dave's signature (Cycle of Telam), I hit 
<a href="http://cherusci.11.forumer.com/viewtopic.php?t=50">a website of Germanic war
strategies</a> whose Google ads were
<ul>
   <li>Free Sun Tzu's Art of War
   <li>Mantis 4-Cycle Tiller
   <li>Menstrual cycle
   <li>Secrets of Sun Tzu
</ul>
The Google banner ad engine is brilliant! I'm always menstruating while using Sun Tzu
tilling strategies. How did I manage to stay alive before Google AdSense consolidated
my purchasing needs like that??

Wow. Received gibberish spam today containing "Staphylococcus". Can't tag that as spam...
<a href="http://seqlab.net">SeqLab</a> would never forgive me.

<a href="http://www.tegels.org/">Kent</a> moved to Sioux Falls?
Frank posted more baby pics, but they're protected by a secret thingy, so I guess I shouldn't
blog them. Baby-snatchers might ID the infant? :)
<p>

Did I mention parenting is hard? Had another incident in the 
Andria / Zach / Jay / food / weight / excercise chronicles last night.
I probably can't blog it w/o upsetting one or more someones, so 
I won't.

There are some sentences which, coming out of the clear blue sky, I will never know how
to respond to. Included in that list is every sentence conceivable that starts with
"I certainly hope that you don't think that I'm such a bitch that you would think that
I would..." No matter what the rest of the sentence is, I'm always dumb-founded.
