Dierks Bentley vs. Dirk Gently

I just got an email from Ticketmaster saying "Buy tix or bid now for your chance to meet Dierks Bentley."
I wonder if <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/06003D45AFB98393?artistid=876505&majorcatid=10001&minorcatid=2&tm_link=tm_home_f9/?dma_id=350">Dierks Bently</a> is related to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Gently">Dirk Gently</a>?
<p>
Further, I wonder why sentences that start with "I wonder" end in a question
mark? I'm not asking whether or not I wonder, I'm stating that I do, in 
fact, wonder. So why the question mark?

Here's one of my favorite <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_West_Wing">West Wing quotes</a>.
Josh is trying to write some campaign material for the upcoming election, Bartlet has had a very long
morning.
<blockquote>
<b>Josh:</b> Why do you want to be President?<br>
<b>Bartlet:</b> I don't.<br>
... long pause ...<br>
<b>Josh:</b> Well, we'll put that in the hopper and show you a draft.

I'm a simple man who takes great satisfaction in the simple things. :)

If I had my shit together I'm pretty sure I'd be outraged by people being incarcerated for <b>years</b> 
by the US without ever being charged with anything. I thought we were the good guys?

Deep ethical quanderies here folks. Wars are bad, um-kay? Can't we all just get along?

I recommend the first 2. The 3rd is OK.

Peter Maass is an amazing war reporter. He has <a href="http://www.petermaass.com/weblog/">a blog</a>.
<a href="http://www.petermaass.com/core.cfm?p=6&weblog=2006_09_01_past.html#115885261868159328">This blog entry</a>
blows my mind. How can people live like that?
Peter links to <a href="http://justzipit.blogspot.com/">Salam Pax's blog</a> from Baghdad.

Rumor has it that you can listen to these great things called <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en&q=%22Massey+Lecture%22+audio&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">Massey Lectures</a> for free online. I haven't
gotten around to it yet.

On December 3rd, 2004, Zach insisted that he was going to write his first story on my laptop. 
I agreed. He sat down with my laptop, furrowed his brow, and began typing. This is how legends are born.
<p>
Here it is,
complete and un-edited:

<blockquote>
<table border=1><tr><td>

Powerful stuff. :) Think I can retire on his residuals yet?
