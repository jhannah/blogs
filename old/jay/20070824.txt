MEMY
Don't know why I can't memorize the phrase "coordinate system." Stupid brain.
I bought <a href="http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=memy&sid=0&o_symb=memy&x=0&y=0">MEMY stock</a> @ $2.17. Let's hope those stage 2a trials make me rich.
Searching Google Books for recent books mentioning "<a href='http://books.google.com/books?q=contig+date%3A2006-2008&btnG=Search+Books'>contig</a>" reveals
a mountain of knowledge I want in my brain... 
I take back what I said about you, brain! Learn... learn!!!
