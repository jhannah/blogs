"You do have some snoring."

No one had called me back, so I called the doc today about my sleep study. They
called the hospital, got a fax, called me back, and reported:
"One episode of an apnea in the 6.2 hours you were asleep, which does not qualify for a CPAP. Do have some snoring. If you're still having excessive daytime symptoms, or if daytime symptoms are ever excessive, we'll look at options to stop the snoring and possibly do a second sleep study."

<p>"I've never had any daytime symptoms I'm aware of... So at the point the medical recommendation is that I'm fine and not to worry about anything?"

<p>"Yup."

<p>"Oh, ok. Thanks." -click-

<p>I don't think Andria is going to think very highly of this result set...
The "some snoring" newsflash is quite the shocker!

<p>We're off to Chicago for the weekend for a funeral. Can someone let our
dogs out to pee? And maybe feed them?
