They grow up so fast...
This morning I discovered the web browser in our home computer has memorized some 
interesting Google search phrases. Some highlights: 
"hot girls in bikeenys", 
"only sexy  jessica simpson", 
"sexy hot women in magizen's", 
"sexy's most sexy's hot's women ever".
<p>
So I guess now that our son is 10 it's time for me to try to brush off my foggy memories
of adolescence for application to the parenting side of this bewildering life phase.
Through no fault of my parents I remember childhood as a frustrating and confusing time. 
I'd wager the parental perspective will be similar. 
With us luck.  :)
