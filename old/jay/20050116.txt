We returned from Orlando last week:
MGM Studios, Magic Kingdom, Universal
Studios, and the Omni Championsgate hotel. It was a blast. The hotel was
gorgeous, had great water stuff, and a free bus to Disney. The pools
were not at all crowded.

I just finished my 3rd DVD home movie with my Mac Powerbook G4 I bought
last year. iMovie and iDVD are way cool. Had to buy a 160GB external drive
to move stuff around. 60 minutes of video takes up nearly 20GB in iMovie, 
then iDVD wants another 6GB or so free to prep and burn the DVD. There's
all sorts of neat effects in iMovie. You can spend hours/days editing, then
it takes 2 hours of iDVD to prep and burn a DVD. Subsequent discs take 45
minutes each. Ouch. So, basically, if I decide to play home movie guy on a
Saturday, the Saturday is gone and I didn't even get to use my laptop for 
normal stuff for fear of jacking up a 2 hour iDVD run... What, read a book?
Do they still make books? -grin-

I should burn a couple short snippets of our home movies to tiny Quicktimes,
but I haven't gotten around to that. Here's the new stills:

Now for my hyperlink spamming... Perl author Simon Cozens retired from computers
to go study @ "God school". He wrote an interesting summary of his Perl career
in his 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~simon/Acme-OneHundredNotOut-100/OneHundredNotOut.pm">farewell address</a>. I ran into <a href="http://public.www.planetmirror.com/pub/crypto.com/hobbs.html">"Locks and Safes: The Construction of Locks"</a>
recently. All sorts of interesting corolaries can be drawn between locks
in the 19th century and open source software today. It's amazing how the past 
is so similar to the present when you scratch the technological veneer off
our "modern" lives. Along that vein, I need to read up more on

These <a href="http://www.mathdogs.com/people/mkc/perl-puzzles.html">Perl puzzles</a> look cool. The 2004 presedential election generated some
