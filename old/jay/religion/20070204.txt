Serenity

If you strip all the God and sin of the world 
stuff out of The Serenity Prayer it's beautiful.
<blockquote>
Accept the things I cannot change.<br>
Courage to change the things I can.<br>
Wisdom to know the difference.<br>
</blockquote>

On the other hand, coping with your child's relationship with a former spouse
is more than ample
grounds for shoving the God and sin of the world stuff back in there. :)
