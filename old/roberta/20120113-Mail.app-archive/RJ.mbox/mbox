If sometimes it seems that time passes much too quickly, disappearing
into an abyss of 'then' within which it is difficult to pinpoint exactly
what happened to all of those millions of seconds, minutes, hours, days,
there are other times that are so impossibly rich and full that those
same seconds, minutes, hours, days no longer seem relevant.  Time out of
time.  

This morning was bright and grey and rainy.  Gray as far as the eye
could see, fat drops splattering in random intervals, but the landscape
suffused with light rather than dull as rainy days usually are.  It was
beautiful.  A few hours later the sky was a patchwork of clear and
cloud.  A few hours after that it was nothing but blue and properly hot
for the first time since I returned to Dunedin a week ago.  I gave up my
pretense of work and went for a walk in the gardens.

I feel eternally blessed to have New Zealand's oldest botanical gardens
literally across the street from my home here.  And for all the dozens
of hours I have spent wandering its grounds (with varying levels of
intensity and purpose), it's amazing to me how often I am still
surprised by it.  Not only by the constant shifting of the trees and
plants from day to day and season to season, nor by the movement of wild
(and not so wild!) birds and other creatures, but by entire sections of
garden that somehow in all of my meanderings I have never before managed
to find.  For example, the mediterranean garden that I stumbled upon
today, up on the hill almost perfectly in the center of everything,
symmetrical stone terrace surrounded by candy-scented bushes in soft
shades of silvery green, punctuated by perfectly pruned cypresses like
exclamation marks at each corner.  One striking bush had needles like an
evergreen but tiny blue clusters of flowers that looked and smelled
suspiciously like sweet peas, one of my favourite plants in gardens in
Canada.  Inhaling their sweet fragrance took me back to all of the many
bouquets of sweet peas I've had over the years, tucked into Kerr jars on
kitchen tables in all of the places I ever lived before leaving the
country.  Delightful!  

The mediterranean garden is just down the path from the Australian
garden that I used to like jogging through at daybreak (back when I did
things like jog at daybreak).  In the frosty air, the eucalyptus oil
cleared my lungs and made it easier to breathe.  In today's humidity,
the scent was only evident when I rubbed a leaf between my fingers, and
rather than clearing my lungs it reminded me of a distant afternoon lost
in a thick fog (literal, not figurative!) in the southwestern Chinese
countryside in which I happened to pass through a large grove of
eucalyptus trees.  With so few visual cues to focus on, the smell was
powerful.  And comforting.  Amidst all the unknown around me, buried in
the mist, eucalyptus was something I knew.  Not long after the path
cleared and I found myself right at the edge of the very place I had
been trying all along to find, and I've barely thought of it since. 
Until today.  Canadian kitchen tables and walks through the Chinese
countryside all in the span of a few footsteps in the garden.  Time out
of time.

One of my old flatmates, a wonderful Botswanan woman who has since
returned to her African home, never, ever, ever walked in the garden. 
Such a loss!  The trees frightened her.  Day or night, rain or shine,
she was convinced the place was unsafe and did everything she could to
avoid it.  Since it is the trees that make me feel most at home in this
part of town, I always found this hard to understand.  Trees make me
feel grounded, less distracted, calm.  I guess this is what happens when
you grow up (essentially) in the forest, versus when you grow up on the
plains like she did.  Different people, different sense of place.

I taught a food course in Changwon this semester, in which we looked at
different international issues through the lens of specific parts of the
food system.  In a survey of my students, only two out of around 60 had
ever grown anything on their own.  Not a garden.  Not a flower.  Not so
much as a bean seed in a plastic cup.  So I shouldn't have been
surprised that they were totally disconnected from the land (as I think
of it).  One group, preparing an assigned class presentation on the
documentary 'Dirt!' called me repeatedly looking for help in making a
connection between their film and food.  'Well, food comes from dirt,' I
tried the first time, 'you know, it grows in the ground.'  The second
time I tried 'plants need dirt to live and a lot of food either IS
plants or EATS plants.  Which grow in the ground.  Which is made of
dirt.'  The third time I knew I had a real problem.  It wasn't a
language problem, it was a conceptual problem.  Having grown up in
cement high rises, homes, schools, offices, entertainment, it was hard
for them to grasp the connection between land and life.  Different
people, different sense of place.

I hope I never lose my sense of awe in green and growing things, my
ability to step outside of time among them and calm my chaotic mind, to
feel that with days like these life is full indeed.  And I hope that you
also find times and places to lose yourself...and to find yourself there
again!

If you recognized the quote in the title of my last post as being from
'The Muppet Christmas Carol' then bonus points to you!  It's from the
song that Michael Caine (as Scrooge) sings at the end of the film, which
has been humming through my head since Friday night when it was
(un?)wittingly used in a speech at the Supervisor of the Year awards at
my New Zealand university.  My main advisor, Greg Rawlings, won the
Humanities super of the year at the event...YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  For any
of you who haven't heard me wax poetic about this man before (and his
impact on my academic life), then let me just say he definitely deserved
the honour!  :)

I started Ramadan alone, and expected to end it the same way.  

For the first 11 days, my morning routine was wake (cursing the hour),
listen for my flatmate to come up the stairs after his breakfast
(sometimes beginning my meal in my room, if I'd thought ahead enough to
have food waiting on my dresser), go down to the kitchen to finish up
hurriedly while leaning against the cold kitchen counter, return to my
room tired and vaguely grumpy about my inability to return to sleep. 
The practice of shifting negative thoughts into positive ones (what in
my mind I think of as the gratitude project) that I was exercising
throughout the rest of the day hadn't yet penetrated the earliest hours.

For the next 11 days (good symmetry there), my morning routine benefited
greatly from the shared company of the same flatmate I'd previously been
avoiding in the morning.  In fact, it was during that period that the
mornings really did become routine.  The hour still felt awfully early,
but somehow not rushing through my food made the whole process of
getting up much easier, and knowing I wouldn't be alone in the kitchen
was good incentive to stop grumbling to myself and just get on with it. 
Which opened up space in my mind for other things - like the gratitude
project I'd had such good success with later in the day.  Instead of
thinking 'Seriously?  I'm going to get up and go EAT something at this
hour???' I'd try to roll out of bed thinking 'Thank you that I have a
warm bed to sleep in and something good to eat this morning.'  

That was also the period that I learned a lot in the mornings, from
conversations with my flatmate.  For the rest of the day we wouldn't say
too much about Ramadan or how it was unfolding for each of us, but in
the morning we would talk about it more.  Sharing some of the experience
of Ramadan with someone who had done it before was invaluable to my
ultimate ability to see the whole month through.  For example, instead
of trying to eat a more-or-less normal breakfast as I had been doing
before, I learned to eat dinner in the morning - no more toast and
peanut butter and fruit and boiled egg for me (which left me hungry by
early afternoon), instead rice and rich meaty stew and yogurt and a
banana (which saw me through most of the day).  

We talked about other things too, often laughing together, which makes
any day a whole lot better right from the start.  Those conversations
helped put me in a good frame of mine for the introduction of other
things into the morning routine.  Instead of coming back to my room and
going straight back to bed (a futile exercise to that point in any
case), I'd take a few minutes first to actually say out loud all the
things I was thankful for (what at that Buddhist meditation retreat I
went to they called 'loving kindness meditation').  The first few days I
did this, my list was abysmally short and vague.  But the longer I
practiced it, the longer my list got, and the more specific.  I started
looking forward to this time.  And, probably since it helped calm my
mind again, it actually helped me begin to be able to sleep again
afterwards (which went miles to improving my general outlook and
productivity the rest of the day).

For the last 6 days, I've been on my own in the mornings again.  My
flatmate's gone to another country, leaving me the only one in the house
still observing the fast.  My morning routine hasn't changed much, it's
just gotten quieter, more introspective.  This isn't a bad thing.  I had
a trigger point massage the other day, the kind where the therapist
figures out which spots hurt the most, and then uses a wooden tool to
dig in and make them hurt even more...ouch!  As she was getting going
she explained to me that she likes her clients to be 'wholly present in
the moment,' to really experience the sensations as they arise and then
to picture each muscle opening up around the pain.  Essentially, she
wanted me to visualize the relaxation of each muscle around the massage
tool, and thus to actually physically cause the muscle to relax.  The
sooner I could unclench the muscle, the faster the pain went away,
allowing her to deal with some of the pesky little knots hiding
underneath the clenching, keeping me from moving freely.  This was a
fair analogy of the fasting part of Ramadan in my mind.  The more I came
to embrace the physical discomfort as just one necessary part of the
total experience, the more I opened myself up to other, deeper aspects
that weren't even in my awareness at the beginning of the month.  And
which do, in different ways, help me to move more freely in the world.

This morning I went down to the dark kitchen at 5am, as usual, repeating
my thankfulness mantra somewhat more forcefully than other days.  Tired.
 Missing the shared mornings with my flatmate.  Wondering what I would
put together to eat.  He told me before he left that it would get harder
the closer I got to the end, and he was right.  Especially considering
this is my last day in Dunedin for quite some time, maintaining my
commitment to see Ramadan through (rather than, say, going for my
favourite french toast brunch with friends), is taking more willpower
than I expected.  Also, I am getting low on food, having finished up the
last of my stews a couple of mornings ago and now just working through
the miserable little leftover bits of this and that ingredient that I
didn't know what to do with earlier.  But rather than opening the
kitchen door to a cold room, I found the space toasty warm.  Nice.  At
first thinking that someone had just forgotten to turn off the heater
before bed last night, I opened up the fridge to find a little care
package of my favourite meaty Chinese dumplings (laboriously handmade
yesterday by another flatmate) waiting for me with an encouraging note
attached.  They weren't there late last night, which means that sometime
between midnight and 5am she came down to the kitchen, turned on the
heater for me, and left me freshly steamed buns to eat.  Though the
others in the house remained tucked up warm in their beds as I had my
breakfast, I was nonetheless not alone.  And that is the essence of a
grateful thought and a thankful heart.            

Much love to each of you as you go about your day.  Thank you for
sharing this journey with me, and all my journeys so far!  Roberta

3 weeks into Ramadan, and I can officially remove every pair of pants I
own without undoing any of their buttons.  I don't think I've lost much
weight, but apparently just enough to change the way things fit.  Hm. 
Probably should have anticipated this, but didn't.  Which brings me to a
few observations on the practical side of fasting.  

I just met another international student for the first time, at the
request of the international office on campus.  She's from the same
general section of planet as me (the west part of N. America), we have
quite a lot in common, she's having a bit of trouble settling into town
and the international advisors thought we'd get along.  And so we did. 
Except that throughout a significant portion of our 90 minute
conversation, over (her) coffee, I was thinking about how I was having
trouble really focussing on what she was saying.  And how hungry the
smell of her coffee and biscotti were making me.  Lesson: it gets
progressively harder to think about anything other than feeding myself
throughout the day - better to plan meetings early!

A certain level of normal activity is fine, but in addition to becoming
a space cadet each afternoon, my body also doesn't have the same
get-up-and-go that it's used to.  I still walk quite a bit, work, play
on the wheel in the pottery studio, go out with friends.  But no matter
how much I'd like to, swimming+fasting is not a particularly good idea. 
I only tried it once, which is probably not a fair sample, but ... wow. 
It's easy to forget how much water our bodies lose while exercising in
water until trying to do it without the benefit of a handy water bottle
(and snacks!) waiting at the pool edge.  I tried to time my swim to be
as near the end of the day's fasting as possible, but that just meant
that the whole getting out, getting dry, getting home, getting fed
routine was WAY more effort than is probably healthy for a person. 
Ditto other strenuous workouts (or too much time on my feet in general).
 A good part of Ramadan turns out to be learning to balance energy and
output, which means prioritizing the things that really need to be done
and letting some of the other things wait a month.  All in all, not a
bad lesson to learn, especially for someone like me who tends towards
perpetual (but not always purposeful) motion.

Dehydration/rehydration is another thing.  This hasn't been the issue
that I expected when I started fasting, ie. feeling parched all the
time.  It's certainly not an issue here like it must be anywhere not
blessed with a steady temperature of about 10C and relatively short
days.  Imagine fasting in northern Canada right now, where an hour
before daylight is something like 2:30 am and sundown isn't until after
11.  Or in Iran, which has long days AND high temperatures.  Or in
Korea, which has high temperatures and ridiculous humidity.  And yes,
I'm pretty sure that there are people faithfully observing Ramadan in
all of those places right now.  And I am truly humbled by their
dedication.  For me however it's not the slightly hollow, achey feeling
in my stomach or the slightly bitter tackiness in my mouth that's the
problem (I got used to both of those things fairly early on, though have
often lamented not being able to swallow a breath freshener during the
day!), but rather figuring out how to spread out my liquid intake over
the hours available so that I don't have to pee every 15 minutes while
trying to get to sleep.  Which is really annoying and really disruptive
of normal sleeping patterns.  Which is next on my list.

Sleeping.  As I mentioned in an earlier post, I'm not all that good at
falling asleep again after waking up early for pre-dawn breakfast. 
Also, being aware that I need to get up earlier than usual often wakes
me up during the night...oh no...I've slept through my alarm...reach for
watch...see that it's only 2:48, 54 minutes since the last time I
looked...drift back to fitful sleep.  And I'm a person who needs sleep. 
A lot of sleep.  I function best on between 8 and 10 hours a night
usually.  So functioning on 5 or 6 hours of not-that-great sleep has had
a much bigger impact that the actual going without food or drink. 
Though I think that I may actually be getting used to this new schedule
now...3 mornings in a row I've managed to get back to dreamland before
getting on with my day!

Stomach noises are something else.  Also, the timing of cooking so that
food is ready to eat at the appropriate hour without requiring too much
contact time with it before I can eat it.  And I wouldn't recommend
baking during the daytime, unless you're awfully confident with your
recipe, because it's hard to keep fingers out of bowls to check on the
progress of things.  I ruined two batches of icing in a row yesterday
because I didn't sample it to check how it was coming along.  The cake,
however, I am happy to report turned out just fine!

I have plenty of observations on the less mundane side of the experience
as well, but at the moment (45 minutes until sundown, roughly), am
having trouble focussing on anything at all other than the incremental
movement of the sun in the sky, and how eager I am for dinner tonight. 
Clearly those are thoughts for a more lucid time of day!  So for now
I'll just say goodnight...blessings to each of you...I hope you are
well.

Only in New Zealand do they talk about 'outbreaks' of weather, as if
snow were some kind of disease.  Though for as often as most of the
country gets snow, I suppose the comparison may be a fair one.  When I
arrived back in Dunedin in June, the mountain resorts were going crazy
because of the complete lack of snow.  The opening of every skifield in
the country was delayed by at least a month, and in some cases
significantly longer.  We had the warmest, driest June on record ever
here in town, and for most of July also enjoyed sunny skies and calm.  

And then, right near the end of the month, we got thumped.  A massive
storm dumped more snow on Dunedin than had fallen in 17 years. 
Everything shut down.  A sense of wonder pervaded the city.  My
flatmates and I (some of whom had never seen snow before in their lives)
made the most enormous snowman imagineable.  Everywhere you went, people
were laughing and playing and taking pictures of the magic.  Now, only 3
weeks later, we're in the middle of a 'once in 50 years outbreak' and
people aren't so happy about th snow.  For one thing, thanks to the gale
force winds accompanying this storm, it feels a whole lot colder than
the last storm.  For another, a once-in-17-years snow break seems like a
gift but a twice-in-a-month snow break seems ominous.  People wonder if
the weather is actually changing, and this is just the start of things
to come.  24-hours into the storm, it's still alternately hailing,
snowing and raining in quick succession, all driven by a truly ferocious
wind.

Inside the house, life is much more settled than what's raging on
outside.  After Saturday morning's uncomfortable kitchen encounter, my
flatmate and I had a looooong talk and helped each other understand
where we each are coming from.  He still thinks I am stubborn (funny,
he's not the only person who has called me that, and I'm not sure it's
entirely complimentary!), but when he'd taken the trouble to prepare my
favourite rice and boil the kettle for my tea Sunday morning before I'd
even come downstairs I knew I was in the clear with him.  Later, when we
were doing our traditional weekly grocery run, it was fun to have
someone else along who stared as longingly at the vast shelves of food
as I'm sure I have been - nothing to make a not-otherwise-hungry person
salivate like a trip to the supermarket!  He checks in on me
periodically, I check in on him.  Though Ramadan remains an intensely
personal experience for each of us, having someone in the house to share
some of the journey with has made all the difference.

Thank you all for sharing the journey with me as well.  I hope that each
of you is well and warm and happy, where ever you are!  Much love -
Roberta

Yesterday morning when I went down to the kitchen, my flatmate who is
observing Ramadan was there.  I'd managed to time my breakfasts until
then so that he would be gone before I came down, never the wiser about
my own observance of the fast.  And actually, thanks in large part to
the fact that I am often an early bird, he didn't realize yesterday what
I was doing either.  Until I told him on the walk to school a few hours
later.  I watched a succession of emotions play across his face,
surprise and bemusement chief among them.  When he told me I should just
go over to the mosque and convert, since I am practically Muslim
already, I'm pretty sure the primary emotion was ridicule.  A few
moments later I thought there might have been a tiny bit of admiration
and solidarity when he asked me how it had been to fast so far.  His
parting words, said with a somewhat exasperated smile, were 'You're
crazy.'

This morning when I met him in the kitchen again he was still smiling,
but I got the distinct impression that it was not a happy sort of smile.
 'Why are you doing this?' he asked, without really waiting for an
answer (which, at 5:45am I would have been fairly incoherent in
delivering in any case).  'There's more to this than fasting,' he said,
mostly under his breath.  On his way out of the room a few moments later
he said 'You should stop.  You wanted to see what it was like, fine, do
it for a day.  You've done that.  Not for 30 days.  You shouldn't be
doing this.'  And then he was gone.

My rationale in not telling him what I was doing right from the
beginning was sound at first.  Ramadan is not an experiment to him, it's
his life (well, part of it anyway).  The first time we ever talked about
religion and belief, many months ago, he told me that he does not
consider himself religious but that he is definitely spiritual.  When he
told me about Ramadan a few weeks before it began he said that it's the
one month a year that he is a 'good Muslim'.  Clearly a significant time
of the year for him.  Now, he is not the only Muslim in the house, but
as it turns out he is the only one who has actually followed through
with the fasting, so for all intents and purposes it was only him that I
needed to be especially aware of keeping it from.  I didn't want him to
feel like I was trying to take something away from him by making my own
observance, or to otherwise make him uncomfortable.  But by doing that,
a relatively significant part of my experience of Ramadan became about
not letting him know that I was doing it.  And at the point when it
stopped being an experiment for me as well, starting every day worrying
about whether or not I was going to meet him in the kitchen seemed like
a poor use of my brain.  It was time to let the cat out of the bag.

Now I know that to reduce the observance of Ramadan to only the fasting
would be a travesty.  But since that's the most visible manifestation of
the month for me, and the easiest to verbalize, it's what I am (mostly)
going to talk about here.  It's 6:30am on a Saturday (I'm not great at
getting back to sleep after my morning meal), and I've spent the last 45
minutes or so, since his 'Why are you doing this?' trying to put into
words exactly why following through with the entire 30 days of Ramadan
has become so important to me.  The word covenant keeps coming into my
brain, as in 'I've made a covenant' (with myself?  with God?), which
strikes me as a fairly antiquated and melodramatic way of putting
things.  And yet there it is.  And I'm sure I'm putting this very badly,
but please bear with me.

Thursday morning I spent 4 hours in a writing workshop hosted by the
university.  Copious amounts of food and beverages were served.  I sat
at a table with three other people who drank and drank and drank
throughout all of our activities (each cup of coffee perched so
tantalizingly close to my nose on our tiny workspace), and ate and ate
and ate throughout all of our (working) breaks.  Torture!  Inside my
head I was railing against the inconsiderateness of all these
(unknowing) people, and against my own inability to consume.  And then
something snapped.  Something good.  A ferocious little voice inside my
head said 'No one is stopping you, go ahead and eat!'  And, ridiculous
as this probably sounds, I finally understood that fasting was MY
CHOICE.  And that it was important to me.

On the second day of the fast I said 'I prefer to think of it as an
experiment in self-control and empathy, as well as a chance to share,
even superficially, a faith experience of a significant portion of the
world's population.'  What I have learned so far is that it is
impossible to share someone else's faith experience first hand.  Also,
it is impossible to remain at arm's length from your own.  At some point
fairly recently (perhaps with the rearing up of that little voice in my
head!) Ramadan stopped being an experiment for me (which implied
something I am outside of, watching from a distance), and started
being...something else.  Something deeply personal.  Something both
bigger and smaller than I first imagined.

Now the question is, how do I begin to explain that to my friend in the
house?

I'm a week into my Ramadan experience, at 11 o'clock on a working Monday
morning, and I'm hungry.  And thirsty.  And tired.  But mostly hungry. 
This has very little to do with Ramadan and very much to do with the 3
days of travel I returned from last night, and the wild storm that blew
through the house into the wee hours sounding like the beasts of hell
descending into my room, keeping me awake.  

As I mentioned last week, travel and menstruation both exempt a person
from fasting, and as a clear indication that god has a sense of humour,
these two exemptions happened to exactly coincide for me.  Meaning I ate
normally Friday through Sunday.  And will not get to eat normally again
for the entire remainder of the month.  Which actually, with the benefit
of today's experience under consideration. is probably a good thing. 
Because it's amazing how quickly your body adapts to changes in
consumption habits!  

When I began this experiment last Monday I was HUNGRY all day.  Tuesday
I was only hungry in the last couple of hours before I could eat again. 
Wednesday and Thursday I didn't even think about food all day.  But here
it is Monday again, with 3 days of food under my belt (quite literally,
I think, in the case of the enormous plate of battered, deep fried,
local muscles I ate for dinner on Stewart Island Saturday), and I'm back
to being HUNGRY again.  Sigh.  They weren't kidding over at the Toronto
Islamic Society (where I went for guidance on what to do and not to do
this month, via their website) when they said that Ramadan is an
exercise in self-control and patience.  I feel like I'm starting all
over again from the beginning today, which I suppose, physiologically
speaking, I probably am.

And so this seems like the perfect time to remind myself that this isn't
about deprivation, but rather about gratitude.  It must be time to think
a bit on all the things I'm grateful for today, rather than on all the
things I'm not eating or drinking.  And so, in no particular order,
here's my list:

#1: I didn't lose my wallet this weekend.  
#2: I survived 2 bumpy flights in a very small plane, and even almost
enjoyed myself in the air.
#3: I managed to drive for hours and hours and hours (in snow and rain
no less!) on the opposite side of the road than I'm used to, without
once going into the wrong lane.
#4: I visited what has to be one of the most beautiful islands on earth.
#5: I completed 2 substantial hikes, in the mud, without totally killing
my (very dodgy) back.
#6: I didn't have to walk back to town in a hail storm.
#7: I had a fabulous travelling buddy who made all of the above
endlessly more enjoyable!
#8: I have the health and freedom to choose to eat or not eat, whenever
I want.
#9: I have family who, upon hearing that I was observing Ramadan this
year, never once asked 'why?' and instead offered only encouragement and
support.
#10: I have work I love to do, which keeps me more than happily busy.

I'm not going to elaborate on all of these right now...spreading them
out a little will give me something to think about later on when it's
normally time for lunch.  Or afternoon tea.  Or...right, back to the
gratitude!  For now, I think the happy story of #1 deserves to be
shared!

I had my wallet all weekend, tramping through the incredible muck of
Stewart Island.  I had it at the airport terminal, where I paid for
parking our rental car over the weekend.  I didn't have it 15 minutes
later, at the gas station where we stopped on our way out of town.  Uh
oh.  I went through the car.  Leanne went through the car.  No wallet
anywhere.  We turned the car around and headed back to the airport.  We
pulled into the parking lot we'd left half an hour before in the pouring
rain, as the sun was setting.  No wallet in the parking space we'd
vacated, or anywhere around it.  We both got out of the car, started
walking towards the terminal down different rows.  Half way to the
terminal I started to seriously panic - my passport (with both my New
Zealand visa and my Korean visa inside), all of my ID, my credit cards,
bank cards, driver's license, everything is in that wallet.  Along with
a couple of hundred dollars in cash since we'd been told there were no
bank machines on Stewart Island (there weren't, but all the shops took
debit cards).  Just before crossing the last stretch before the
terminal, Leanne let out a happy yelp and started jumping up and down. 
My very black wallet had landed on the only yellow patch of paint laid
down in the entire parking lot, and was still there waiting for us with
absolutely everything inside.  What's more, even though the outside was
soaking wet from the rain, inside, everything was bone dry.  Now THAT is
seriously gratitude inspiring!!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

And on that note, I ought to get back to #10, work.  More on #s 2
through 7 sometime soon (I think 8 and 9 are pretty self-explanatory)! 
I hope that you are all happy and healthy and full of gratitude this
fine (stormy) day.  My love to each of you!  R

What business does a Christian girl from the Canadian prairies have
attempting to observe Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting?  Probably
none.  And yet, here I am in New Zealand, doing just that.  From an hour
or so before the sun rises to sometime shortly after sundown, for the
next 28 days (give or take a few days for travel and menstruation, both
of which temporarily exempt me from fasting), I will not be eating or
drinking anything.  Not even water.  

In light of the fact that Ramadan is not only (or even mostly) about
deprivation, while I'm at it I'm going to try to be more mindful of
other people, and of God, and of myself.  Decreased food consumption,
increased mindfulness - a kind of package deal.  There are myriad
lessons that abstaining from food (and other things!) during the month
is supposed to teach a person - not the least of which is patience,
something which I surely could (always!) use a refresher on.  Ditto
perseverance.  It's supposed to help clear your mind (what PhD student
doesn't need that?!), give you greater empathy for the poor (hunger and
thirst suck, so let's help those who don't get to change that condition
once the sun sets), erase divisions (everyone, regardless of social
status, gender, or nationality observes the fast together), and promote
sincerity (no one can really tell if you're following your fast or not,
so it's all up to you).  It's also an acknowledgement of the gifts of
Allah in the world, and regardless of whether or not you are a
particular believer, it seems to me a good idea to stop every now and
again and really be thankful for how bountiful the world we live in is.  

To be clear, I'm not converting to Islam (not that there would be
anything wrong with that if I did).  I prefer to think of it as an
experiment in self-control and empathy, as well as a chance to share,
even superficially, a faith experience of a significant portion of the
world's population.  This is not wholly unlike the two weeks I spent in
silence at a Buddhist meditation retreat in Thailand a few years ago. 
Different deprivations, similar aims.  I wish I could say that I went to
that retreat out of a pure and sincere devotion to spiritual
development, but actually I went because a friend bet me that I couldn't
keep my mouth shut for so long (he was wrong).  Similarly, I wish I
could say that I am embarking on this journey with a pure and sincere
devotion to spiritual development, but really it's as much curiosity as
anything.  I'm curious about this foundational experience that so many
people around the world share, and also curious about whether or not I
can actually get through a whole month without eating or drinking (two
things which are very dear to my heart, especially here in hyper-social
Dunedin) during daylight hours.  Also,  to be perfectly honest, I'm a
practical sort of person and figured that if I'm ever going to have a
serious go at observing an entire month of fasting, it ought to be here
in the middle of a New Zealand winter when the temperature throughout
the relatively short daylight hours is neither too hot nor too cold.  If
there were ever going to be ideal conditions for an experiment such as
this, these are them.      

Now, disclaimer aside, I do think that more will come of this month than
the satisfaction of my curiosity.  Though I hated pretty much every
single minute of my 2-weeks of silence, and swore that I would never do
anything so ridiculous (for me - understand that I am not calling the
practice itself ridiculous...) again, it turns out in the end that I
actually learned an awful lot at that retreat.  Things that I still
practice, or think about, today.  There is no question in my mind now
that I actually learned some important lessons sitting there under the
palm trees with the monks, such that I look back on the whole experience
almost fondly and have even considered going back.  I could not have
imagined, even in the middle of that experience, what would come of what
I learned.  Likewise, I have no idea what will come of what I undertake
this month.  But I firmly believe that when people step out in faith
(even in misguided or selfish faith), we do not step out alone.  God
(whatever god you conceive) meets us.  The world meets us.  We meet our
(better) selves.

Which brings me back to the present, with the sun just beginning to dip
behind the hills ringing my horizon, preparing to break my fast for the
(second) day.  One of the best things about Ramadan, in my estimation,
is how social it is - how you join with your friends and family at the
end of the day to celebrate your abundance together.  Unsure of how it
would make my (very dear) Muslim friends here feel to have someone like
me essentially tagging along for the ride during their holiest month, I
haven't told anyone here what I'm doing.  Instead, I'm telling you.  And
hoping that, fast or not, you will share my enormous gratitude tonight
(and all this month) for the tremendous abundance we are so blessed with
- an abundance of which each of you are very much a part.

Quick note again, to let you all know that (YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!) Thomas is
doing great and has been discharged from the hospital!!!!!  His
grandfather says 'The recovery was very quick once it started.  Still
needs to be monitored for awhile.  Grandma is very very happy and very
thankful for your support and  prayers.  She said for me to say:  "I am
a firm believer in the power of prayer."  

Thanks again to everyone who wrote and who thought about Thomas and his
family over the last couple of weeks.  :)

Lots of you have written to say that you're keeping little Thomas in
your prayers and thoughts since I sent out the short note about him last
week.  Thank you!  This is an update about his progress.  He remains in
hospital, basically on a roller coaster ride - his grandmother says that
it seems like for every step forward he makes he takes another back
(take heart - at least he continues to take those steps forward!).  This
weekend he had surgery to begin some kind of dialysis, which will be
ongoing for at least a few days, as well as a blood transfusion
yesterday in response to dropping hemogoblin levels.  But despite that,
his nurse aunt who has gone out to support him and his family says he
seems to be a little more alert and even got to visit with his little
brother for a while which helped to cheer him up.  He is fighting hard,
and can still use all the help we can give him!

A quick note this morning, of a different sort than what I usually send
out.  A good friend of mine has a 5 year old grandson battling an e-coli
infection in a hospital in Edmonton.  Whatever your beliefs, he (and his
family) could use all of the prayers or love or energy or support or
whatever you can send him.  His name is Thomas, and he's in the fight of
his life right now.

The topic of this evening's English lesson was 'Hang in there!'  As
examples of how to use the idiom correctly, the text book I was using
provided a listening activity where three different people were talking
about their problems learning various languages.  As a follow-up, I
asked the student I was tutoring (though tutoring isn't a very accurate
word for what I do with this extrememly advanced and precocious girl -
banter may be a better description) for some advice on how to study
another language effectively.  Completely deadpan (and without missing a
beat) she told me, 'Well, for starters, you should be less than 7 years
old.'  When I pointed out that she, at 12, and me, at considerably more
than 12, were both well outside her optimal range for language
acquisition, she replied, 'in that case, I guess we'd better just hang
in there, because it's gonna be a whole lot harder for us!'

Later in the lesson, she filled me in on the progress she's been making
towards her goal of getting taller.  A couple of weeks ago she got it
into her head that somehow jumping rope 800 times every day would do the
trick, which left me with distinct memories of a Judy Blume book I read
as a kid ('Are you there God, it's me, Margaret' I think).  To the best
of my recollection, the elbow-swinging 'I must, I must, I must increase
my bust' mantra didn't actually have the desired effect on the character
in Blume's book, and predictably neither has the jump rope routine led
to any perceptible height increases for my student in the last 14 days. 
What it has done, however, is to lower the girl's weight by 2 kilograms
- something that she's very, very happy about.  And I am not.

This girl is a perfectly normal 12 year old.  None of the North American
euphemisms for being overweight (even a little) apply to this kid.  She
is not chubby or chunky or ample or big or hefty or husky or plumpish or
pudgy or round or stout or tubby or zaftig (which, incidentally, is a
really great word...zaftig).  Not in the least.  What she is is petite
(both in width and height), not surprisingly considering her two petite
parents, and smart, and healthy.  And, apparently in her mind, still 1
kg heavier than she ought to be.  

In a Chinese newspaper I was reading a couple of weeks ago (just before
this jump rope fetish started), there was an article about the physical
condition of approximately 7000 university students in Beijing.  In
China, all students hoping to enter university (or any other new level
of schooling, from middle school up) must go through an examination of
their physical condition before admission, and then again just as they
finish up in order to enter the professional job market.  Which means
that the country has pretty good stats on the changing shape of young
people.

According to the article, less than half a percent of all students
taking the professional physical achieved an excellent rating.  46% of
all students failed the test entirely.  This is the test that measures
things like how many sit-ups you can do in a minute, and how flexible
you are, and how fast you can run a specified distance.  Not stellar
results (I wonder what they'd be in North America?).  More worrying to
the analysts though, was that a huge proportion of both male and female
students were not at healthy weights - a key indicator of future medical
expenditures.  According to the tests, 27% of all male students were
OVERweight.  And 40% of all female students were UNDERweight.  And it
got worse...the same trends could be seen on physical examinations at
every level of schooling beginning in middle school, except the younger
the students were the more exaggerated the gap between them was.  So
proportionally the most number of overweight males in the pool are the
youngest boys, and the most number of underweight females are the
youngest girls.  Yikes!

Now, I know a thing or two about not being at an ideal weight.  I've
spent over half my life either actively dieting or feeling guilty about
not dieting more actively.  About 90% of the time (currently) when I
look in a mirror my first reaction is 'YIKES!', an unhelpful sentiment
that is not greatly aided by the reckless abandon many Koreans use in
telling others exactly what they think about them ('You look so tired
and sick today,' for example, or 'You have an enormous pimple on the end
of your nose,' or 'You're really fat').  In my case this reaction is
exacerbated by the fact that, thanks in large part to a persistent
intestinal disorder I carried around for the first few years I was here
but thankfully no longer have, I was once (in the not too distant past)
A LOT smaller than I am now.  In fact, for a brief period, about HALF of
what I am now.  I walk around in New Zealand, not precisely satisfied
with my body, but at least not at all out war with it.  I can find
clothes that fit me (and look good), shopkeepers don't immediately chase
me out of their stores.  People talk about the weather or school or what
happened on Masterchef last night, not about my need to lose weight.  I
walk every day and go to the pool, workout in the pilates studio, go
entire days without thinking about my size or what it says about me to
others, feel pretty good about myself (physically, I mean...thank
heavens I've never had any problem with negative chatter about other
parts of my being!).  And then I come back here and am feeling like a
whale again within about 48 hours (and who wants to go workout when they
feel like everyone is constantly judging them?).  I know this negative
chatter in my brain does nothing to help the weight-loss process (and
unlike my student, I really could stand to jump rope a few hundred times
a day...), nor does it help make me more productive in any other area of
my life.  Which is why I really hate to see someone like this perfectly
healthy, beautiful, witty, smart, lovely 12 year old already learning
how to hate her body.  How do we stop her (and so many like her) from
becoming that 40% of underweight women (which exists in Korea as well),
or one of the countless women (like me) who ought to be perfectly
thrilled with their lives but instead spend untold brain energy judging
themselves instead?

I told my student that if all of her energy goes into trying to get
skinnier, then there'll be nothing left to go into making her taller. 
She thought about this for a minute or two, agreed that might be true,
and then switched back to our conversation about language study.  'I
suppose if you think you can, then you will,' she said, about learning
to speak another language.  'But it'll still be A LOT harder for old
people,' she added, looking pointedly at me and the Korean books in
front of me, 'so you'll REALLY need to hang in there well.'

I've been living in the same city in Korea for almost eight years -
longer than I've been in one place other than my hometown ever, in my
whole life. And even my hometown is a record that I'm closing in on - I
was there for just 10 years before heading off to university. Which is
to say that I consider this place home, as much as any place ever has
been. This city and this country - I am a local here.

Except that I'm not. No matter how local I feel, I will always be a
foreigner here.

Woman at lunch: 'Wow! You eat Korean food very well!' Me: 'I love Korean
food.' Her: 'You know what that is?' Me, taking a little more of a very
common side dish: 'Yes, I have been here for a long time.' Her: 'But
most Foreigners don't eat Korean food well!' Me: 'I think you don't go
out with many foreigners. Most of the people I know like Korean food
very much.' Pause, eating. Her: 'Wow! You even eat that?! Do you know
what that is?' Me: 'You've got to stop being shocked every time I put
something in my mouth. Really, I like Korean food. I've been eating it
for a long time.' Her: 'But you are a foreigner! Foreigners don't like
Korean food.' And so on, and so on. 

Not too much surprises me in Changwon anymore. I know how the city, the
first planned one in the country, came to be imagined and then built. I
know where the good restaurants are - the ones that only locals know
about. I know which days the traditional markets are in which locations.
I know how to get from here to there and from there to here and how to
give other people directions to all those places. I work, pay taxes,
even vote (if I want to). Changwon is not a curiosity, it's where I
live. It's my home.

But the other day, walking from home to a store on the other side of
town, I went through the road-side stalls of one of the traditional
markets. These markets are held every 5 (or so) days, on dates that end
in a particular number (for example, the market downtown that I usually
frequent is held every 4, 9, 14, 19, 24 and 29 of the month). This
market is on 1s and 6s, in an older residential neighbourhood and has a
grittier feel than 'mine'. As I was getting near the end, after the
usual noodle makers and flower sellers, fruit vendors and snack stalls,
I happened past a woman portioning out an animal carcass with a big
cleaver at a folding card table. As you would expect, all of the hair
had already been removed and the body was clean and smooth, the head
already severed, lying to one side. At first I thought it was a pig - a
very common sight in markets - but then it occurred to me that for a pig
it was very, very small. I took a closer look, just as the woman began
hacking off a back leg for a waiting customer, and saw that the animal
was a dog. Whoa, foreigner again.

Now, the fact that Koreans sometimes eat dog meat is well known. In
fact, I have eaten it myself on more than one occasion. Done well, the
soup is rich and flavourful, and very, very expensive. This is not the
family pet we're talking about. They're dogs bred specifically for
eating, much as we breed pigs or chickens to eat. The soup is considered
a kind of food-medicine, particularly good for men. It used to be much
more common than it is now - a lot of my students (the first generation
raised with pet dogs at home and unable or unwilling to make the
distinction between them) have never had it, and finding dog-soup
restaurants has become more and more difficult, even during my time in
Korea. Which is why I was especially taken aback by the dog in the
market. 

Professor in passenger seat, driving back from departmental outing on an
island a couple of hours away: "How do you drive in Korea?" Me: " What
do you mean?" Him: "How do you know where to go?" Me: "I've lived here
for a long time." Him: "But you are a foreigner." Me: "The signs are in
English and Korean." Him: "But you are a foreigner." And so on, and so
on.

Stopping at a roadside rest area for breakfast, same drive. Him, taking
my arm: "Come, let's take a shit together." Me: "Excuse me??" Him,
pulling me to an empty table behind the counter: "A shit, let's take a
shit." Me, mentally: "Oh, SEAT! He wants us to take a SEAT together."
Yup, still a foreigner. No matter how long I stay.

Climbing the mountain behind my house this morning, I came across a
super shiny, black worm with a distinct hammer-shaped head. Something I
had never seen before, despite climbing that particular trail possibly
hundreds of times in the last 8 years. At home, after finding an exact
photo with my first google search for 'hammerhead worm', I learned that
it's a species common to this part of Asia. And that it's the only kind
of worm that exclusively eats other worms, by (seriously disgusting!)
dissolving them. Usually they're nocturnal, which I guess is why I've
never come across one before, but there's no shortage of them around.
They can survive blistering heat and freezing cold (both of which we
have in abundance throughout the year), and if you try to kill them by
squashing them or cutting them up (I don't want to know how people
discovered this) each separate piece just becomes its own little worm.
Wow. Now that's something awesome to discover in your own backyard! 

Strange new (common) worm, oh right, I'm a foreigner! Instead of
thinking of it as an insult, I'm just going to remind myself that being
foreign is also another way of saying, 'living in a perpetual state of
newness, astonishment and awe.' And who could complain about that?

Yesterday was Persian New Year - Happy Nowruz! I hope that the year 1390
is good to us all! 

Among other places, Persian New Year is celebrated in Iran. How
embarassing is it that a few months ago, I, who am an International
Relations professor and not generally a completely dumb person, didn't
know that most Iranians are Persian. Or that the main language of Iran
is Persian. Or that Persian and Farsi are the same thing. I'm not sure
I'd actually considered WHAT the people of Iran might be called (other
than Iranian), because truth be told, I'd never thought much about Iran
at all. I was quite content for my knowledge of that part of the world
to be limited to what I 'learned' from the 1991 movie 'Not Without My
Daughter' (whose uncritical reception into my brain I am blaming on my
youth when I watched it), and what the ongoing procession of news
stories about Iran say in the media I most commonly watch (the NY times,
CBC, BBC, NZHerald).

I guess a person can't be interested in EVERYwhere ALL the time. It's
reasonable to think that each of us has a sort of awareness radius that
is tuned to certain places and certain people at certain times,
depending on our experience. So it's not my general lack of knowledge of
things Persian that troubles me. It's how easily I allowed what
knowledge I had to be bounded by those extremely limited sources listed
above. How I never, not for even one story that I read about crazy Iran
and its crazy leader, stopped to ask the question 'What's so crazy about
them?' or to look a little deeper than the paper in my hands. 

And I should know better than to generalize people that way. When I
first came to Korea, my best friend was (is) a man who had lived and
travelled throughout Asia for several years. I would go visit him, thumb
through his masses of photos, and he would ask me where I thought a
particular picture was taken. I learned pretty quickly to always answer
China. Even though I had never imagined that one country could contain
even a fraction of the magnificence and diversity that I saw in the
various prints. How had I never known this before, I wondered, that
China is such an incredible country? How had I never ached to go there
and discover it for myself? The first vacation I got I took a boat to
China, and have been fully enamored ever since. 

The news I read about China is pretty much never right. MY China, and
the China in newspapers, don't have a whole lot in common. This is
something I've come to expect, and to make adjustments for when adding
to the big China file in my brain. Which is not to say that China
doesn't have any problems - of course it does! Just that it pays to try
to keep the big picture in mind when considering what I read.

And don't even get me started on Korea! I live in a very modern and cozy
two-bedroom apartment on a quiet residential street in a city whose
standard of living is easily the highest of any I have ever lived in. I
went to the doctor this afternoon, a doctor who completed his residency
at Harvard, in a state-of-the-art private hospital that would turn any
of the Canadian or American or Kiwi doctors I know green with envy. And
it cost me $5 for the medicine I was prescribed. Afterwards I got a tall
Chai from an upscale coffee chain to soothe my throat and browsed a
selection of multi-lingual books that I might have wanted to read in bed
later, before taking a luxury taxi home (for $3.50). There is nowhere in
town I wouldn't walk in, alone, at any time of the day or night. And my
grad school colleagues back in Canada (IR majors all) once had an
earnest discussion about whether I was living in a more dangerous
country or whether that 'honour' fell to our classmate busy starting an
NGO for refugee children in a camp in Palestine that was mortared at
least once a day. This is what happens when you take the news too
seriously. You forget that places are real, and that people everywhere
are just people, like you. Both more and less than any 60 second news
story you could ever read about them.

Somehow, however, these revelations about one part of the world never
managed to penetrate that part of my brain responsible for thinking
about other parts of the world. And this is a problem because I teach
about the world for a living. 

One of my flatmates in New Zealand, where I study when I'm not at work
in Korea, is from Iran. He seemed nice enough right from the beginning,
but my first inkling that things were probably not as I had imagined
them in his home country came the morning he was telling me about this
Canadian TV show that ALL his friends used to watch back home. This
REALLY popular show in Iran, called 'Due South'. You could have knocked
me over with a feather that entire day...of all the shows he might have
mentioned, the cheesy mid-90s comedy/drama about a ridiculously polite
mountie in Chicago was definitely not the one I was expecting. We had
fun trying to remember all the characters names together (though really,
who cares to name anyone except that beautiful dog Diefenbaker?), and
laughing at the absurdity of that shared connection. It turned out to be
the first of many connections.

Aside from TV shows, our family lives also have much in common. And our
childhoods. The paths of our educations. Even our cats look alike. His
family is Muslim, mine is Christian, and I had no idea whatseoever that
that would make as little difference as it does to what we think, and
dream and do. He shows me pictures of Iran with the same enthusiasm that
my friend in Korea used to show me pictures of China, before I'd become
as enthralled with it as he is. And I feel that same sense of absolute
wonder imagining all the possibilities there. Iran is a place that's
going to be as important to me in its own way as China already is, and
probably for the same reason - because it has opened my mind and made my
world infinitely bigger.

Now that I'm paying attention, I hear a lot of different people make a
lot of different comments about Iran on a pretty regular basis. People
who, like me, should know better. That China is the great economic and
imperial worry of North America and Iran the religious is pretty
accepted rhetoric. Which makes it pretty okay in a lot of different
circumstances to make disparaging comments about, based on very little
actual knowledge. Now that the face of Iran has shrunk for me, from a
featureless mass (that I wasn't afraid of, exactly, but certainly wasn't
rushing out to get to know better) to a single real individual, I find
these comments hurtful. And want to do what I can to help other people
think beyond them as well.

I gave a presentation about Iran in my classes the other day, as an
example for my students about looking beyond the news when talking about
places. I started with a slide show of pictures from various places in
Iran, and asked everyone what country they thought I would be talking
about. Knowing my history, the first guesses were predictably Canada and
New Zealand. When they saw a photo of the capital in winter, the
majority decided that it was in fact Bern, Switzerland. The sense of
wonder on their faces when they discovered that the snowy city was
Tehran and that it is smack in the middle of the imagined desert of the
middle east gave me a glimpse of the wonder I feel every time I learn
something new about Iran. 4 distinct seasons were the beginning for me
too. Followed by fields of fragrant roses. Pistachio farms. The
birthplace of Shiraz and polo. Some of the world's best caviar. A
consolidated history going back almost 5000 years! Comparing some of
that history of Iran with some of the history of Korea made it very easy
for my students to contextualize what they were learning, and, some of
them told me later, made the place seem real to them for the first time.
 I can relate...'Due South' did it for me.  And who knows how many more
worlds will open up from here?

Today is my birthday.  Happy birthday to me!  To celebrate, the weather
is PERFECT (a rare thing indeed in Dunedin), and I've been with Anne to
visit the little penguin we rescued from Sandfly Bay on Saturday night. 
It turns out that SHE is not a Fiordland Crested Penguin, as we thought,
but instead comes from a tiny group of subantarctic islands a whole lot
farther away.  Snares Islands.  There are about 30 000 Snares Island
penguins left in the world, but because they (typically) only inhabit
that one little cluster of rocks in the sea, they are listed as
vulnerable by the WWF.  Who knows how she came to be on our beach, but
if we hadn't picked her up there would definitely be one less of her
kind in the world.  

The very kind keeper at the penguin hospital let us have a good long
look while telling us about their operations.  You can see pictures on
my blog (www.robertajenkins.blogspot.com).  She is still very
underweight, but is doing great and should be fine to return home once
she's been fed more.  She's already gotten through most of her moult,
and looks like an entirely different bird than the one we picked up - no
more patchy, featherless splotches or listlessness.  Now she's sleek and
shiny and black, and wandering around the enclosure on her own.  She
even has a little friend, another Snares Island penguin brought in
recently by someone else!

So this story has a very happy ending.  And a better birthday present
would be hard to find!

A 6.3 magnitude earthquake earlier this week somehow caused the largest
recorded ground shaking in New Zealand history.  Experts are still
trying to work out exactly how the relatively small initial jolt
(compared to the 7.1 quake that hit the same city 5 months ago) became
what it became - the deadliest natural disaster ever in New Zealand. 
Their best guess so far is that the first shock waves impacted the
basalt hills that ring the city and were reflected back on themselves
and magnified - right into the heart of Christchurch.  At lunchtime.  On
a sunny Tuesday.  That changed the city forever.

4 days after the quake, 145 people are confirmed dead.   Over 200 people
remain missing.  Over 2000 people have been treated for injuries,
including some who remain in critical condition in hospital.  80% of
Christchurch has no water.  30% has no power.  Large sections of the
city have been flooded by burst underground pipes.  The damage is
unimaginable, and heartbreaking.

But this is not that story.

This story is about a little, lost penguin, very far from home.

As my friend Anne and I pulled up to the car park tonight for our
regular Saturday evening volunteer duty on Sandfly Bay, suddenly she
turned to me and exclaimed 'Ooh, I have butterflies in my stomach,
tonight isn't going to be good.'  There were a lot more vehicles in the
lot than usual, and most of them were local (often the hardest people to
deal with on the beach, because they feel like, being local, they can do
whatever they want and don't need to listen to anyone else) rather than
the rental campers that we more often see.  The weather was calm and
sunny, and people were out to enjoy.

We picked up the notebook that volunteers record each night's happenings
in at the top of the (loooong, very looooooooooong) hill, and began the
steep climb down the sand dunes to the beach as usual.  We stopped at
the viewing platform a couple of hundred meters below the parking lot to
survey the bay, the same as we always do, and immediately noticed a
large cluster of people at the base of the trail.  Anne pulled out her
binoculars, started to scowl, and pointed out the penguin in their
midst.  And then started down the trail at record speed.

The thing about penguins at Sandfly Bay is, they are very, very, very
shy.  Of people.  Of other animals.  Even of other penguins.  So the
fact that this bird appeared to be sitting right in the middle of a
large group of humans was very alarming.  More alarming still was how
those humans were behaving - swarming all over the little creature,
cameras flashing away, giving it no space at all to be.  The posted rule
on the beach is that people shouldn't get closer than 200 meters to the
penguins at any time.  And here were 10 or more people only an arm's
length away.  From a clearly troubled bird.

Anne is in better shape than I am, and has been making the trip down to
the beach as a volunteer for the last 3 years.  Tonight was my 6th time
ever.  She made it down faster than I did.  The bird was scrawny and
quite listless, with large patches of feathers missing thanks to the
fall moult.  A few of the people were very cooperative and followed her
instructions to move back without any complaints.  Some took a little
more convincing (after having asked him politely several times to back
off the bird, to no avail, one man started swearing at her when she
finally just stepped in front of his camera).  She got the unenviable
task of staying there and trying to keep everyone a safe distance away. 
I got to take the cell phone back up the dune until I could get a signal
to call for the Department of Conservation duty officer to come down for
a rescue.

It is over a kilometer from the beach to the car park.  Straight up.  It
was another 1.3 km further along the road (up again) until my phone got
enough of a signal to call out.  The duty officer was very busy, having
already had two other emergency calls before mine.  Her instructions? 
Please pick up the penguin, carry it up to the road (ah, the dune
again!), and she would meet us there to take it to the hospital.  

It took considerably less time to get back down to the beach than it had
to get to the point where I made the phone call.

Anne was sitting on a dune, quite a few meters back from the bird, with
about 7 people around her.  We transferred everything from the soft
fabric shoulder bag that she carries on the beach into my backpack, got
her polar fleece ready for an ambush, and approached the bird.  A
Fiordland Crested penguin, approximately the entire breadth of the
country away from where he should have been.  With me in front of him
and Anne behind, he raised his wings half-heartedly but didn't even try
to run away.  Anne draped the fleece carefully over him, took him firmly
in two hands, and together we manoeuvred him into the bag.  Keeping well
away from his impressive beak (which didn't protest his capture too much
in any case).  And then we started up the dune.  Again.

It is a testament to how tired and weak the bird must have been that he
barely tried to move the entire way up to the car.  Anne was a
superstar, carrying him the long way up the dunes, without stopping once
to rest.  I, having just made the climb once, was considerably slower. 
Still, we both got to the car faster than we'd ever managed it before,
with no complaints from our little passenger.  We nestled him into the
safest spot we could think of in the car - on the floor behind the front
seat, with the bag straps wrapped around a locked seat belt, and drove
up the road to get another cel phone signal to (re)contact the duty
officer.

I had never seen a Fiordland Crested Penguin before tonight.  It was a
strange (and incredible) feeling to have one riding in the car behind
me, wrapped in a sweater, seat belted in.

The duty officer, Mel, turned the corner in her DOC truck at just the
moment that we got cell coverage to contact her.  We all pulled over to
the side together, and transferred the bird.  I will probably never,
ever in my life again get that close to that kind of penguin...holding
him in my hands, as Mel removed the coverings and moved him into a
plastic pet carrier in the back of her truck.  Even with half of his
feathers missing, he was still beautiful - twin rows of vivid yellow
feathers standing straight up along either side of his sleek, black
head, red beak long and sharp, eyes bright.  A wild penguin.  In my
hands.

Next stop for the bird was Mel's house for the night, where he'll get a
good meal before going on to the penguin hospital in the morning.  He
didn't appear to be injured, just very, very small and hungry.  During
the 2 week moult penguins don't go to sea to feed, but instead stay on
land, scratching old feathers out to make room for the new ones, not
eating.  If they're not heavy enough to get through the two weeks when
the process begins they're in a lot of trouble...not waterproof or
insulated enough to go out to feed, but not strong enough not to.  It's
a precarious time for a penguin.  For this penguin, nearly his final
time.

With the penguin safely on his way to good food and great care, Anne and
I decided to head back down to the beach one more time to finish our
regular rounds.  There were still a lot of people out, and since it was
still a couple of hours before dark more birds would probably be heading
in.  We arrived just in time to sit down with a group of young
Brazilians to watch a Yellow-Eyed penguin waddle ashore, and then
another, and then another.  We watched a couple of giant sea lions
showing off their bulk.  And a baby fur seal manically chasing a penguin
from rock to rock to rock.  And we watched the sun set, over one of the
most beautiful stretches of land on earth.  And then we walked up the
enormous dune again.

There was a plea in the newspaper this week for people to bring bagged
lunches to a drop center at the university to send up to volunteer
rescuers in Christchurch.  They asked for non-perishables, like
chocolate bars, granola bars, cookies, and cans of tuna (fruit and
drinks were donated en-masse by some local companies to add at the
scene).  Today you can't buy canned tuna in a single store in Dunedin -
thousands upon thousands upon thousands of lunches were donated. 
Walking home from my office (beside the drop point) this afternoon I saw
all of the people coming, bags in hand, and the pallets of food already
packed up and waiting to be loaded onto the donated trucks to go. 
Everyone doing their little part to make a difference in this disaster.

Walking up the dune for the 3rd time tonight, I felt the same sense of
awe I felt when looking at all those lunches.  What we do does make a
difference.

When I got into my office yesterday morning, the first thing I noticed
was a ziploc bag on my officemate's desk labelled 'FEMUR' in bold, black
letters.  Stepping over to have a closer look, I saw that it did infact
contain a bone, about 10 cm long.  Since her last book (my officemate is
a distinguished emeritus professor) was about the history of a kiwi
confection (the much adored pavlova), it's easy to forget that she is in
fact an archaeologist.  And deals with bones a lot, for a living.

Yesterday afternoon, another student stopped me as I was heading out of
the building for a spinal x-ray.  'For yourself, or for a subject?' he
asked.  Reminder number two that I am surrounded by archaeologists.

The anthropology department at Otago includes both archaeology and
social anthropology (or 'so-sh' - soc - as we're usually called). 
Although archaeology is nowhere on the official letterhead, they
outnumber us soc people by about 3-1.  Meaning we pretty often have, um,
unusual things lying around.  Like massive muddy toolkits.  Bones.  Tiny
bags full of endless pieces of broken ceramics.  The list is pretty
endless.  The environmentally controlled door at the end of my corridor
leads to the 'Ancient DNA lab,' beside which is a room full of
rubbermaid containers stacked with flaked stone tools (some ancient, and
some 'recreated' by students).  And discussion around the lunch table
often includes topics like how the theory of 'Optimal Foraging Distance'
factors into whether we should walk to the ice-cream shop on the corner
for dessert despite the constant rain or stay dry in the tea room and
suck on old sugar cubes instead.  Or how incredible it must have been to
be one of those first Polynesian people who came across to New Zealand
in a flimsy canoe, only to discover that the weather was horrible and
the entire place was full of (pardon my language, this is a direct
quote...) 'Fuck-big chickens' (aka: Moa).  I LOVE academia!!

But all work and no play...well you know.  So, on Sunday night, Anne
drove me to Pilot's beach to see the Little Blue Penguins. 45 minutes
each way on a very narrow, very windy road along the harbour coast of
the peninsula...can you say car-sick??  And BEAUtiful!  The beach is a
tiny crescent of sand at the base of Taieroa Head, which is the rocky
hump of land at the very end of the penisula home to a (protected)
colony of Royal Albatross and a whole lot of shags (those are birds too,
I think).  As we climbed the hundred meters or so of stairs down to the
viewpoint just above the water, an albatross lazily rode the wind
currents above, all 3 meters of his wingspan stretched out and
magnificent*.  (*Authors note: I feel that as an Otago resident, I have
to use words like 'magnificent' to describe Albatross, which are
practically a local obsession.  Truth be told, however, although the
concept of a bird with a wingspan so large it can only take off in
gale-force winds is interesting, I think they look like overgrown
seagulls and am not very enamored of them in general.  I much prefer
looking for possums on the fenceposts around Taieroa Head, which are big
furry things that look like a cross between a house cat and a raccoon,
even though people here think they're evil - mostly for doing things
like eating albatross eggs - and do their best to kill and make socks
out of them.)

Little Blues are very different than the Yellow-Eyeds I'm used to
seeing, and although they're much more common I hadn't managed to see
one in all of my three visits to Dunedin before.  Instead of coming
ashore one at a time, they group together in the water in 'rafts' and
then once critical mass is reached they make a break for the beach and
swarm up all at once.  Incredible.  The speed at which they move in the
water is amazing, and then there they are on land, waddling as fast as
their tiny legs will carry them.  And at 20cm total height full grown, I
do mean TINY legs!  I could hazard a guess as to why they're called
little BLUE penguins, but the truth is that since they only come ashore
at dusk, by the time they went by me it was so dark they might have been
wearing neon t-shirts with 'Welcome to New Zealand!' printed on them and
I wouldn't have had the faintest clue.  It was the rustling sound of
their dragging tails in the grass that mostly tipped you off if one was
near, or the red light of the special volunteer flashlights (bright
lights scare them, but apparently they're colour blind?) outlining their
squid-full bellies.  Lucky for me, said red light was so busy pulling
everyone else away to a little group shuffling along the viewpoint fence
that Anne and I had the loner taking the back way home all to
ourselves...so close that it almost walked right over my foot (I'm
pretty sure that one wasn't wearing a t-shirt, though I wouldn't rule a
tuxedo entirely out of the question).

On an unrelated topic, it seems that this old listserv is still
functional afterall, since I did get a reply or two to my message last
week.  And I don't think I've updated the membership to it since it was
first created...a LONG time ago.  So if you're getting these messages
and would prefer not to, please let me know and I'll remove you from the
list (if I can work out how...remember, I've never done ANYthing with
the members lists before!).  Of course the opposite is true too, so if
I'm missing you (in which case I assume someone kindly passed this
along) and want to be included then I can add your name.

I hope that you are all well and happy, wherever you are.  Much love. 
Roberta

The best thing about summer in Dunedin is the sixteen hours of sunlight
- not quite as much as in Grande Prairie, where I grew up, but still
plenty to bracket all of the things you could hope to do in a single
day's light.  I'm not one of those people whose general mood shifts with
the absense of sun, but I'm also not a huge fan of running around in the
dark, so I tend to be much more productive in the summer.  When the 6pm
sun looks like a 2pm sun, it seems reasonable to have a lot of activity
left in the day.  (When the 6pm sun is a moon, on the other hand, it
seems reasonable to make some dinner, curl up with something hot in
front of a movie and then head to bed.)

My friend Anne is a Yellow-Eyed Penguin Trust volunteer at Sandfly Bay,
on the peninsula near here.  For about 7 months of the year, during the
breeding and chick-rearing seasons, she spends her Saturday evenings
from 5pm until dusk (about 5 hours this time of year) on the beach
giving people information about the wildlife they see and keeping them
far enough away that the animals aren't disturbed.  Since both the
penguins and the Hooker's Sea Lions that make the beach home are
critically endangered, this is a really important job.

For the last two Saturdays in a row, I've gone down to Sandfly with
Anne.  The first week I went out of curiosity, having seen the bay from
the lookout point on the hill (high) above, but never from sea level.  I
followed her around all night, being a tourist and also soaking in the
information (which I heard repeated about three dozen times).  The
weather was calm and beautiful, the white sand comfortably warm, the sky
alive with shifting clouds coloured extravagantly by both a long sunset
and a full moonrise.  The two chicks on the cliffs at one end of the
beach spent hours out on a rock, fluffy and grey and distinctly
un-penguin like, while their parents cuddled on a ledge below.  At the
opposite end of the beach, another penguin waddled through the masses of
fur seals sunning themselves and on up the steep hill to its nest,
tilting the whole way at an alarming angle but making it nonetheless. 
One playful sea lion kept popping in and out from behind various sand
dunes at people, or laying across the (only) path up to the viewing
hide, absurdly resembling a very eager (and overgrown!) puppy.  Except
for the brutal climb up a very steep, very long and very shifty sand
dune at the end of the night to get back to the car, it was pretty much
a perfect evening.

I woke up the next morning with sand in my bed and a smile on my face. 
Having passed the volunteer 'test' (ie, still smiling and asking for
more), the second Saturday Anne put my name in the log book and put me
to work.  The weather wasn't nearly as nice as the week before, although
at least it wasn't raining on us like it was on the city.  The name
'Sandfly' didn't come from the bugs (which are nasty biting things
common elsewhere in NZ, but not here), but rather from the persistant
blowing that creates what Anne euphemistically calls 'textural winds' -
air you can literally see.  I spent a significant portion of the evening
bundled into my winter coat, shaking sand out of my ears.  Having
volunteered on the beach for the last 3 years, she was smart and had a
scarf to wrap around her face, lawrence of arabia style, to keep out the
worst of the gusts.  And despite the grey, people came...and animals
too.  Many, many more of each than the beautiful week before.

The chicks were out on their rock again, newly penguin-like with
white-bellies beginning to venture down to the lower ledge where their
parents yelled encouragement.  My job was to sit at the base of the dune
that leads to the beach, 200 meters back from the cliff, and catch
people first thing when they came down.  So many interesting people! 
For an over-talkative, know-it-all, teacher type, this was pretty much a
perfect job for me.  The fact that it was on what is probably one of the
most spectacular stretches of sand anywhere in the world, filled with
penguin 'song', was also a perk!  Anne spent most of her evening at the
opposite end of the beach, at the viewing hide, helping people avoid the
very, very active sea lions.  During a quiet spell later in the evening,
we walked down the beach together with 3 young French people, just in
time to see a succession of penguins pop out of the waves and make for
their nests inland.  And also in time to see 2 big male sea lions have a
fight (at the base of the path to the viewing hide, of course, where a
group of tourists were stuck), with 2 baby girl sea lions playing in the
grass behind them.  Up and down the beach sea lions came in and out of
the waves, sizing people up as possible playmates, and penguins waddled.
 I talked to people from Scotland, Germany, France, Switzerland, Canada
(from my old university!), New York (big strapping guy who owns a
florist on 5th...fun!), and Uruguay.  Easily worth every grain of sand I
injested throughout the night.  And next day.

Today it's sunny for the first time in a long time.  So hard to sit in
an office, working, with the green grass so inviting outside.  Maybe
I'll take my books out to the quad for a while and read with the
birds... I hope you're well wherever you are!  Much love, Roberta

I am not Jewish.  And neither are my friends Sue, Ron or Tessa.  And yet
the four of us got together last night for a Shabat dinner - the Jewish
custom which ends the work week and prepares everyone for the sabbath
ahead.  2 atheists, an agnostic and a christian.  

Sue was married to a Jewish man for about 31 years, though she never
converted and never learned the prayers.  She just spent a horrific (and
by horrific, I mean - OMG!!!) 10 days in the hospital after slipping on
the ice and breaking her leg into tiny little pieces, and had a yen to
repeat a tradition she'd practiced for so long and lost touch with upon
her return home.  We were all inclined to support her, even if we didn't
have any idea what to do.  Ron grew up on a 'secular kibbutz' in Israel.
 He didn't know the prayers, but did have a friend in the local
synagogue who lent him a hebrew bible and explained what to do.  I lit
the candles.  He read the prayers in Hebrew and then explained them in
English (as much for his own benefit as ours I think!).  Cut the bread. 
Tessa served the food.  It didn't feel like a bunch of people with no
clue playing at religion - it felt warm and close and blessed.  Sue was
smiling, we were all smiling.  And I suppose God meets us wherever we
are, however we come to the table.

Sue's experience in the hospital makes me hope that I NEVER need medical
care in New Zealand.  Saving you most of the gory details, let me
suffice by saying that her multiple displaced fractures and dislocations
did not qualify her as an emergency, despite the fact that the bones
continued to move around and further pulverize themselves inside her
busted leg for the entire 6 DAYS that it took them to get her into
surgery.  At which point the damage was so extensive that she required a
second surgery 3 days later to finish the job.  She now has more metal
in her leg than leg in her leg.  Ouch!  

In other news, kapiti ice-cream is just as luciously creamy and
deliciously wonderful as I recall from last year when I was here. 
Carmelized pear and ginger, manuka honey and fig...now THAT's ice-cream!
 This winter's weather has been much milder than last, meaning the green
grass and hearty roses blooming around town make me feel as if I'm
living in a perpetual state of spring (when ice-cream consumption is not
completely ridiculous).  I've learned that there are no squirrels in New
Zealand, which I find endlessly strange and fascinating, but that there
is another plague of rabbits sweeping across the island.

My PhD is officially in progress now, and I actually feel glimmers of
proficiency from time to time (unlike last year's panic attacks!).  I
spend most of most days in my shared office, reading, writing, chatting
with colleagues, and checking my email 8000 times.  It's a sweet life! 
When I'm not in my office, I'm wandering about the countryside soaking
in the wide open spaces and strange familiarity (so much looks so much
like Canada!).  Unlike last year when I arrived not knowing a soul, this
time I have a great network of friends which makes things MUCH less
lonely (though possibly also much less productive in absolute writing
terms!).  My committee continues to be great, and things are moving
along.

There is much, much more to say, but my stomach is telling me that I
forgot to eat lunch today after wandering through the farmer's market. 
Now that it's nearly 3pm, the voices are getting lively down there!!  So
I will save the next musings for another message... hope you are all
well and happy, wherever you are!!  Much love to you all!  R

This message deserves to be MUCH longer than it's going to be, mainly
because I am so excited that I can't stand to keep my butt in a chair
long enough to do it justice.  So you can expect a follow-up sometime
soon...

I just got a full scholarship for my PhD in New
Zealand!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Those of you who have an inkling of how many of these awards I've
applied for over the last 3 years will know what a big deal it is to
finally have this nailed down...and I feel GREAT!

(it's getting harder and harder to stay seated people!)

No, I'm not leaving Korea.  Yet.  The university will allow me to keep
my job and collect the award.  :)  So for the time being I am continuing
as before - full-time student and full-time professor - FUN!  When that
scenario changes I'll let you know.  In the meantime, the most exciting
thing about all of this is now having something acceptable to put on my
student visa application form for the NZ gov't!!

YIPPEE, YIPPEE, YIPPEE, dancing circles and jumping for joy!!

Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays to you all and hoping your homes are as
full of joy as mine is tonight!
Love, Roberta

At 7:30 this morning, towards the end of a 6km run in which far more
energy was expended choking back sobs than keeping my feet moving
forward, the rice paddies near home were newly green, bursting with
life.  Already at 6am, when I climbed the mountain to bury my too-tiny
kitten, the fields and paths were full of old women and men, planting. 
It strikes me more every spring, how old the farmers are getting.  The
same people who did the work when I arrived, long before I arrived,
getting a little slower and more bent over each year, still working.  No
young people ever take their places.

It is possible that running through tears is a more productive use of
energy than just curling up in a pathetic ball on the bed and wailing
away.  Certainly it frightens my rabbits less.  But the whole point of
the endeavor was to wear myself out too much for the waterworks to keep
on, something you'd think would be relatively easy after a sleepless
night spent crooning to a miniscule fur ball in obvious distress growing
weaker by the hour in the crook of my arm.  And yet here I am, 6km
later, crying over every little thing (figuratively and literally) with
no apparent end in sight.  Lesson: running may strengthen your heart,
but not for stuff like this.  Nothing strengthens your heart for this.

Today is my birthday. 32 years. I feel incredibly lucky that they have
been such good ones!


Yesterday morning Lily and I went to the local PSB (Public Security
Bureau) to extend my visa. I've done this several times on other trips
to China without any kind of trouble, so didn't worry about dates when I
booked my plane tickets a month ago. My visa expires on Thursday. I fly
out on Saturday morning.

Before spending an hour on the bus, Lily called the Visa helpline to
make sure I had everything I needed. The woman asked me if I'd done this
before. I told her yes. She asked me if I knew what to do. I told her I
should take my passport and 160 yuan in and fill out a form. She said
yes, that's it, perfect, have a nice day.

After spending an hour on the bus, the woman at the PSB had a somewhat
different opinion about exactly what I needed. Temporary resident
permit. Photos. Financial independence certificate. Visa application
form. Plane tickets. And money. Lots and lots of money.

When she was enumerating all the things I was lacking, the PSB woman was
more than a little intimidating. People in uniform waving official
looking documents all typed in a language you don't understand inches
from your nose have that effect. Having never encountered this before I
was at a loss as to what exactly to do. Lily, who is absolutely
wonderful but always has a lot on her mind, amped up my anxiety. The
more the woman at the desk waved the papers around and talked about
money the more anxious I got. 

Wondering if I would have to empty my bank account or leave the country,
I fled to Timothy at the university. Luckily he and his best friend Cai
have calmer heads than I do. After a blissfully short initial panic
period, they took the typed guide the PSB officer had given me and
started to go through things one at a time. With telephone in hand,
calling various friends and authorities for clarification. Cai kept
repeating to me over and over again, don't worry, this isn't serious, we
can take care of this together. And, think of this as training for next
time!

First thing on the list, a temporary residency permit. From the police.
Not wanting to bother Lily again, Timothy calls his friend Mabel who
lives on campus nearby. She lived in Canada for several months recently
and is working on her PhD in a field similar to mine. It was reasonable
that we would know each other. And having been helped a lot with
bureaucratic hoops in Canada she was happy to help out. We went to the
campus police together.

A lecture ensued. Students should be living in the dorms, they should
NOT be renting their own apartments. And they should definitely not be
accepting foreigners into their homes without first getting police
permission. You are Chinese! You should know these things!! Mabel wanted
to ask him how, how am I supposed to know these things, but instead she
bowed meekly and appologized over and over again. Lecture concluded, the
officer told us that we weren't in the right police office anyway. He
gave us directions to the appropriate office a 20 minute walk away. 

Neither Mabel nor I wanted to make any trouble for her. So she decided
to call the other police station first, and ask them some questions
about the process and requirements before going in. All of the answers
being totally satisfactory, we set out. Only to be foiled a second time
because she is not the owner of her home. Only the owner can apply for a
temporary residency permit.
Both of us really wish they had told us this on the phone. Not wanting
to send us away with nothing, the officer told us helpfully that if I
registered at a local hotel, even if I didn't stay there, then my
information would automatically be uploaded to the PSB and I wouldn't
need a permit from the police. So off we went to find a cheap hotel.

It turns out that there are 2 kinds of hotels near the university. The
first are beds mostly used by eager lovers not wanting to share their
passions with their many dorm mates. This kind of hotel does not
register its guests and was therefore useless. The second are expensive
tourist hotels, for visiting scholars and families. Though they could
have given me the form I needed, I couldn't afford the bill. The foreign
guesthouse on campus was not too expensive. But after going through all
of the registration procedures they informed me that because I'm not a
student they couldn't give me the paper I needed anyway. Bringing me
back to square one. Defeated, Mabel and I returned to the guys at the
dorm. The PSB would be closed soon anyway.

When I gave Lily the update, she was offended that I would try to go to
a hotel before asking her for more help. I assured her that I just
didn't want to cause her any more trouble. She assured me that there was
nothing she wanted to do more. Which brings me back to my birthday...


This morning Lily and I went to the local Police station (third one in 2
days!) to register my 'temporary residence'. Apparently this is
something I should have done within 24 hours of arriving in Chengdu - I
must have missed the memo on bureaucratic rules when I bought my plane
ticket. Lily lies on the form with ease, saying that I just arrived in
the city yesterday. Though it takes some time to complete the paperwork,
the women at the counter are friendly and we have no problem getting
what I need.

Another Chinese friend, Charles, meets us at the station and I am handed
off from one to the other for the trip back to the PSB. My intention was
not to deal with this today, of all days, but Charles is adamant that we
should get it done as soon as possible. Luckily for me, I listened to
him.

At 10:30am, the Visa section on the second floor of the PSB is not
crowded. Unlike the massively thronged first floor. I hand over all my
documents to the woman behind the imposing marble counter. She peruses
them disinterestedly, hands them back. Where are the copies of your
passport and visa stamps? Where is your financial statement? The first
are definitely NOT listed on the guide form I was given just one day
before. And the second should be issued by this woman, now, as she well
knows.

I take out my plane tickets, all completely paid for. I take out my
resident papers that show I am living with a friend. I take out my
small-ish wad of 100 yuan bills and my bank card and 2 credit cards. She
sneers. How am I supposed to know if those cards will work here, she
asks. I want to see cash. $100 US per day - minimum $500. Glancing at my
passport, she adds not-very-helpfully that I can bring an equivalent
amount in Canadian or 'another currency' if I prefer.

Then she refuses to talk to me any more.

Charles and I go out to find a copy machine and a bank. The duplicates
are easy, but we walk for quite a while before stumbling across a bank
that either of us can use. Rather than paying the exorbitant exchange
rate to take such a large sum out of my Korean account and then have to
carry it around with me until I get back to Korea, Charles takes the
money from his account. It makes me nervous to have such a large bundle
of someone else's cash in my hands. When we get back to the PSB at 12:01
we are informed that it's now lunchtime and the office won't reopen
until 1pm.

Charles and I wander the back streets until we find a rickety little
bench next to a dumpling vendor. He is worried about me eating street
food, but the food is delicious. I couldn't imagine a more perfect
birthday lunch. We talk and talk and talk, and the world seems good
again.

At 1pm, I am the only person in line at the PSB. The women behind the
counter all argue about who should serve me, before the same woman
finally clicks the sign to call my number to the front. She glances at
me purposefully when I reach the counter, before snapping her gum and
returning to her magazine. She reads 2 more pages, excruciatingly
slowly, before setting it aside and reaching for my papers.

You know this visa will only be for a maximum of 30 days, she says. As
my plane tickets shows, I am leaving the country on Saturday, I reply.
Saturday, she asks. But your visa won't be ready until Monday. She has
already looked at my plane ticket twice today. She knows very well what
day I am leaving. You should have come in last week, she says, pushing
my papers back across the counter. What happens if I don't file for an
extension, I ask. She glares at me coldly and tells me that then I will
be in violation of Chinese law and will be detained. She suggests that
if I need the visa urgently, I should produce my plane tickets (again)
and fill out another form. Then she pushes the button to call the next
person.

This is not going according to plan.

Charles and I step aside to fill out the other form. When I go to the
counter again with the new form, the woman tells me I don't have a copy
of my plane tickets. Without a copy, what's she supposed to do? As she
asks this, she deliberately scans another form using the miniature
copier next to her chair. She doesn't even need to move to do this. I am
dismissed again.

On my next visit to the counter, she can't find anything wrong with the
papers I've assembled. To complete the financial form she asks for my
wad of cash, but she doesn't touch any of it. I could be holding a stack
of red paper for as long as she glances at it. We walked all over town
for this??? Friendly now, she smiles and draws me a detailed sequence of
what happens next...on Friday, when I come to pick up my newly minted
visa just hours before my plane flies off to Qingdao and then Korea.

By this point you are wondering why on earth the subject of this looong
message is 'I want to live in China'. Here's why.

After the PSB debacle, Charles takes me to a traditional tourist street
which is delightfully free of tourists despite the abundance of charm.
Then we go to meet a group of church women that I met at a conference in
Korea 2 years ago. They greet me as if no time has gone by at all, as if
I am family.

Since it's my birthday, they take me for a traditional Chinese foot
massage. 4 strong and handsome men enter, wearing sharp suits with their
ties tucked into their breast pockets, carrying steaming wooden tubs
full of herbal water. It smells divine. While we soak our feet, they
knead our necks, shoulders, backs. Did I mention they are all REALLY
attractive? This might be what heaven feels like.

After the massage, we all go to a fancy tofu restaurant a short walk
away. The chairs are tall and elegant, giving the illusion of privacy
even though there are dozens of tables around us. The food is unique and
amazing. My stomach soon joins my feet in a state of absolute bliss.

On my way back to Lily's, carrying bags of gifts and half a cake to
share, the square near the apartment is full of women dancing in unison.
The choreography is intricate and graceful, the women all shapes and
ages. Beside them, the oyster bar has just recieved a shipment of
shellfish and 4 uniformed chefs are haggling with the fisherman over the
price of the streaming crates. The briny scent of sea permeates the air.

Everyone I pass is smiling, enjoying the warm evening. And I smile too.
This is a place that feels like home. And I am happy to pass another
year here.

The Tibetan part of Chengdu is totally different from the rest of the
city. Instead of street after street of identical women's clothes shops,
sportswear, computer repairs, and non-descript cement apartment blocks,
it is a riot of colour in a haze of smoking insence. Vibrant in every
sense of the word.


I have a cooking class at a guesthouse here at 2pm. Timothy puts me on a
bus near the university that I've never been on before, one with no fare
box but rather a young woman in uncomfortable looking heels collecting
money in exchange for little paper tickets. As we are pulling away from
the curb Timothy begs the driver through the open window to please help
me get off at the right place. After a month of travelling together he
has a pretty good idea of how often I get lost from missing my stop on
busses.


Though most of the streets the bus travels I have never been on before,
this is one destination it is impossible to miss. The transition from
'modern China' to 'old Tibet' is striking. As soon as I see the first
wine-robed monk spinning his tiny prayer wheel I know I am close.
Shortly after, shiny glass display windows give way to dark entries
overflowing with sundries of Tibetan Buddhist life...prayer flags,
beads, wheels, idols, offering bowls, jewellery, cushions, clothes,
industrial blenders for yak butter tea.


Not only the driver, but also the ticket woman very kindly help me off
the bus at the correct stop. Though I am near a popular tourist area, I
am the only tourist to be seen. Riot police however are out in force.
This is the Tibetan new year and the area is tightly patrolled. The
women shopping have long braids strung with silver and beads, lined
wrap-dresses that emphasize their slender height. Many of them carry
infants. The men are mostly in monks robes, elaborate saffron hats all
variations on a theme. Both are oblivious to the bored looking soldiers
with loaded automatic weapons slung casually over their shoulders up and
down the streets. Their faces are as different from each other as mine
are from either of theirs. I feel as if I have entered another country
entirely, just by crossing the road.

I'm in New York for the summer (Ithaca, not the city), but start the new
semester in Korea as usual in September.  Probably my last year
though...been spending half my time in Korea and half in Ithaca for the
last year or so.  Before that Amy was in Korea doing her
fieldwork...she's an anthropologist (we met in Korea).

There've been a handful of mails over the past few months... will look
into them. :)

R

Ebay for computers, eh?  Never thought of that...

Apartment hunting has taught me a few things about my neighbourhood.=20
For one, there are a lot of really, really nice people around.  For
another, there are a lot of really, really crappy places to live.=20=20

Over the last couple of weeks I have walked up and down every street
within a half hour radius of my office =96 that=92s a lot of streets.  Not
just once mind you, but repeatedly.  Unlike the apartment hunting that I
am used to in the =91west=92, through newspaper or on-line ads, housing
offices or friends, here the most =91efficient=92 way to find something is
to go from phone pole to phone pole and read the handwritten fliers, or
simply to look on the front gates of the houses going by.  The papers,
if you can read the runny ink after the spring rains, say how many rooms
are available for rent, occasionally how much money they are expecting
to get, and a phone number or two.  There=92s never an address listed,
making it pretty much essential that you keep your phone handy.

People who answer the phone generally fall into 2 categories=85those who
are patient with my halting language skills and those who respond to my
fumbling with rapid-fire tirades followed abruptly by the dial tone.=20
Luckily, there have been more of the former than the latter (which has
pleasantly surprised me, given that my experience on the street so far
has mostly been the opposite).  My Korean is getting the workout of the
century, first trying to figure out where the actual rooms are located
on these convoluted streets (where not just one but TWO different sets
of addresses are in active use), and then finding out the details of the
space and whether or not I can afford it.

Unfortunately, patience and kindness on the phone are no indication of
the quality of the rooms available=85which are mostly awful.  I have been
in Korea long enough not to expect much in the way of size, but even
still I am shocked by just how many truly miniscule apartments there are
for rent.  And by how rampant mold problems are around here.  One
charming spot I saw this morning was so mold-ridden that when I opened
the door I felt like a whole army of tiny green spores were hacking at
my nose with musty little axes.  The walls were the same colour as the
mossy stones at the temple up the road.  =91Don=92t worry,=92 said the help=
ful
adjumma in Korean, =91we=92re going to re-wallpaper before you move in.=92

The few spots that aren=92t totally depressing are exorbitantly priced.=20
The traditional rental system in Korea relies on =91key money=92 rather than
on monthly rent.  You pay a big bundle upfront, which the landlords
invest while you live in the space rent-free (or, more recently, with a
minimal monthly fee), and when you move out they refund the total
original amount.  Key money for a decent 2 room apartment around my
house (smaller than the smallish one bedroom apartment I had in Edmonton
while I was going to university, for those of your who remember it) runs
between 40 and 60 million won =96 about 40 =96 60 thousand dollars.  Yikes!=
=20
A little out of my budget.  When I tell people that I have about a
thousand dollars available for key money they=92re so flabbergasted they
don=92t even laugh (a typical response to embarrassment here).  One old
man summed up my problem thus: =91Come back when you have money.=92

On the very rare occasion that I have found something that is reasonably
sized, reasonably clean, AND where the landlord is willing to negotiate
price into my ballpark (a mean feat indeed!), the apartments are snapped
up at light speed.  Twice the places that I was looking at were rented
between the time I called to make the appointment to see the space and
when I walked the 2-5 block distance from the flier to the house.=20
People don=92t plan much in advance to move into the kind of places I am
in the market for, so the first one they see that=92s halfway decent they
snap up immediately.  No time for mulling things over.  This means that
if you are decision-impaired like I am, and need time to think about
things, then you are probably SOL.

And yet, despite all these assorted traumas of looking (I can=92t
emphasize enough how demoralizing it is to see hole after hole after
hole and suddenly realize how many people around me live in places like
that), I have managed to find a new apartment!  And a couple new friends
as well.  Yippee!!  And all of that just 4 short blocks from where I
live now.  A mere few hours ago I would not have thought it possible.

On my unhappy way home this morning after a marathon 4 hours of walking,
calling and looking, I happened to see a flier stuck to the wall of a
new house that hadn=92t been there when I=92d set out.  I figured I=92d
already called a couple of dozen places, what was one more?  From the
moment I stepped inside I knew it was the one.  High ceilings, lots of
(unbarred!!) windows, a cute little private patio that=92s about 2 feet
wide and 15 feet long.  Built in gas stove, washing machine (in the
kitchen, naturally), air conditioner.  Storage room.  All of it so new
that the plastic covers hadn=92t even been removed from the window frames
and door knobs yet.  And landlords willing to accept my paltry one
million key money in exchange for a raised monthly rent.  Unbelievable.

Even though I was about 85% sold on it immediately, I still wanted to
talk it over with a couple of people and have my Korean friend Anna look
at it before I signed on the dotted line (and handed over my only wad of
cash =96 I won=92t get the key money back from the house I=92m in now until
the start of July).  I made an appointment with the real-estate agent
handling the property for later in the afternoon and went on with my
day.  2 hours before our appointed time he called to make sure I was
still coming in=85two other people had made better offers than mine and
were standing in his office.  Anna graciously agreed to meet me early
and much to the other renters=92 dismay, half an hour later the place was
officially mine.  I think they=92re still in shock that the realtor
accepted less money just because I=92d seen him first.  Thank God for
small miracles.=20=20

So June 2nd is moving day!  Classes will be done for the semester
(halleluiah!), and I will have a 2 week grace-period after that before I
have to be totally out of my house.  A good chance to whittle down the
mass of stuff I have accumulated over the last 5 years here and do most
of the moving by hand (I=92ll hire a truck at the end for the big stuff).=
=20
Also a good chance to say good-bye to this much-loved home slowly,
rather than in a box-maddened rush at the last possible minute.  If I
have to leave, which of course I do, then this is as good a way to do it
as I could imagine.

As for the new friends, it turns out that one of the apartments I looked
at a few days ago (which I could definitely NOT afford) is owned by a
woman who goes to the same church as Anna.  They didn=92t know each other,
but when she saw us together and then saw Anna at church this morning
she put two and two together and gave me a call.  Her house is half way
between where I live now and where I=92m moving to =96 just around the
corner from Anna=92s own house.  It seems that all the church women had a
pow-wow after services discussing my =91renting problem=92 (an entertaining
and slightly horrifying thought) and came up with a plan to help me.=20
When they learned I=92d found a place they were delighted and instead of
enacting the plan had Anna and I over to the house for tea.  30 minutes
of light refreshments turned into several courses of food and a
sing-along lasting several hours.  I have never seen Anna talk and laugh
so much in my life!  The whole thing was a huge success and they=92re all
getting together again later this week, with or without me.=20=20

AND my garden cat had kittens this morning.  What a great day!

Be well, much love to you all!  R
