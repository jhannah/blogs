<div style='background-color:'><DIV>
<DIV>
<DIV>I don't know how I expected my last day in Suji to be, but I&nbsp;know that it wasn't how&nbsp;it did happen.&nbsp; After&nbsp;just over 4 months in the place, I ended up leaving just as I came in - straight from work to the&nbsp;bus and off alone into the night.&nbsp; I'd already packed&nbsp;up my things and shipped them ahead, said tearful good-byes to&nbsp;my students (I was fine until the 5th graders started crying).&nbsp; After my full&nbsp;day at the&nbsp;school (marked as the rest of my stay was, by annoyances from the incompetent management), there was nothing left but&nbsp;supper and&nbsp;a taxi to Suwon for the&nbsp;midnight express south.&nbsp; Perhaps the best thing I can say about Suji outside of the kids (who I really did enjoy) was atleast there was terrific symmetry to my experience there.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I slept hard&nbsp;for the first half of the bus ride, waking up at the midway rest stop looking like a disgruntled porcupine, hair sticking straight up in a series of&nbsp;short spikes.&nbsp; Small wonder all the people in the mosquito infested bathroom enjoyed staring at me so much.&nbsp; I didn't care though - I was on my way to a new life!!&nbsp; I arrived in Changwon at 4:30&nbsp;am in the pouring rain - identical conditions to my first arrival 3 months ago.&nbsp; It felt like a shower&nbsp;washing away all the hurt and frustration of&nbsp;my job in the north -&nbsp;a feeling&nbsp;cemented&nbsp;later in the morning when I threw open my big windows to a city scrubbed clean and shining under&nbsp;a brilliant blue sky.&nbsp; The incredible realization that "now this is home!" hit me so hard it took my breath away, and I know I probably wouldn't have felt it so strongly if I hadn't gone through what I just went through to get it.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>My first day living in Changwon (&#xC2;&#xF7;&#xA4;&#xB7;&#xBF;&#xF8; for future reference) was one of those rare perfect days.&nbsp; I&nbsp;only found 1 cockroach in my previously (mildly) infested apartment,&nbsp;and&nbsp;had no problem dispatching it before finding homes for the rest of my stuff which arrived by courier early in the day.&nbsp; On my walk&nbsp;to&nbsp;my office I met another new professor (from the English dept.) and the two of us hit it off immediately. Erik is an american who has been living in Asia for the last 9 years and enjoys a lot of the same hobbies I do, so we had plenty to talk about in our many hours together (he lives on the same block, and has an office in the same buidling as me on campus).&nbsp;&nbsp;He's also a VERY experienced prof (at 38 he's had a bit more time than me to perfect the art) who has been full of helpful advice and resources, halleluia.&nbsp; We both spent the day alternately&nbsp;getting to know each other and working, which was very, very satisfying.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I spent&nbsp;the early evening visiting the Beans - a wonderful family nearby who adopted my predecessor and have shown every inclination&nbsp;to do the&nbsp;same for me.&nbsp; The father was away fishing for the day, but the mother and kids and I had an impromptu Korean cooking&nbsp;class&nbsp;together in their big kitchen.&nbsp; She's a really fun lady, and took it to heart when I said I love to cook, deciding that Saturdays will be our "special food" days.&nbsp; We will take turns - one&nbsp;Sat. she'll teach me to make a traditional Korean dish and the next I'll teach her to make something western.&nbsp; Yesterday was&nbsp;&#xBC;&#xF6;&#xC0;&#xE7;&#xBA;&#xF1; (soo-jay-be), a savory fish stock and vegetable soup full of&nbsp;paper thin handmade&nbsp;noodles flakes.&nbsp; I was surprised by how easy it was to make and&nbsp;by what a great teacher she is.&nbsp; We all had a great time&nbsp;(even the boys, whose job it was to knead the noodle dough forever&nbsp;and coat the kitchen in&nbsp;a fine dusting of flour in the process), and I am looking forward to our next visit together.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Erik and I met up again after supper and spent the rest of the evening at the public sauna, laying on the heated floors, eating ice-desserts, talking, sweating and relaxing.&nbsp; You can spend a whole day there if you want to - all for the low, low price of $8 - making it&nbsp;about the cheapest entertainment going (not to mention a great hotel alternative, if you don't mind a bit of&nbsp;noise and activity around you while you sleep).&nbsp; It was absolutely perfect for easing the stress and soreness of moving, which&nbsp;Erik had very kindly helped me do when the shippers came earlier in the day.&nbsp; We finally emmerged from the "amethyst rooom" (my favorite!) around 10:30, with that pleasant floaty feeling you get when you are very tired and very relaxed, ready for imminent sleep.&nbsp; He walked me home, which is&nbsp;unnecessary here strictly speaking, but which I had missed a lot from N. America, and I was out cold about the same time my head hit the pillow.&nbsp; Perfect.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>This morning when I got up, well rested, I took my tea by the tiny lake at the entrance to campus.&nbsp; The mists were still rising off the very green mountains around me, and the lotus flowers were all opening up on the water.&nbsp; In the midst of them was a slender, gray heron catching its breakfast and looking for all the world like an oriental painting.&nbsp; Stunning.&nbsp; I was the only person up and around anywhere I could see (except Erik, as it turned out, who met me with breakfast at my office a few minutes later), and it was wonderfully peaceful.&nbsp; About the most worshipful Sunday morning I could ask for, especially with the ringing of all my church friends voices still in my ear from the previous morning (they are at a camp together and had called together to welcome me to my new home).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>After breakfast I tried out the climbing wall behind my building.&nbsp; It's a bit dilapidated and questionable looking, but it seemed solid enough and with the sounds of the waterfall behind it in the background, it was a great bit of exercise first off in the day.&nbsp; A bit surprising to find holds full of water or bugs, but I imagine I'll get used to it quickly enough.&nbsp; Now I've spent the rest of the morning at work, and am on my way for lunch (or groceries...).&nbsp; Looking to be another perfect day so far.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And on that note, I will go tend my growling stomach and then get back to work.&nbsp; I hope this finds you all as wonderfully content as I am at this moment.&nbsp; My love to you all (big, big, happy sigh).&nbsp; Roberta</DIV>
