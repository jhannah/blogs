<pre style="margin: 0em;">Yesterday morning when I went down to the kitchen, my flatmate who is
observing Ramadan was there.  I'd managed to time my breakfasts until
then so that he would be gone before I came down, never the wiser about
my own observance of the fast.  And actually, thanks in large part to
the fact that I am often an early bird, he didn't realize yesterday what
I was doing either.  Until I told him on the walk to school a few hours
later.  I watched a succession of emotions play across his face,
surprise and bemusement chief among them.  When he told me I should just
go over to the mosque and convert, since I am practically Muslim
already, I'm pretty sure the primary emotion was ridicule.  A few
moments later I thought there might have been a tiny bit of admiration
and solidarity when he asked me how it had been to fast so far.  His
parting words, said with a somewhat exasperated smile, were 'You're
crazy.'

This morning when I met him in the kitchen again he was still smiling,
but I got the distinct impression that it was not a happy sort of smile.
 'Why are you doing this?' he asked, without really waiting for an
answer (which, at 5:45am I would have been fairly incoherent in
delivering in any case).  'There's more to this than fasting,' he said,
mostly under his breath.  On his way out of the room a few moments later
he said 'You should stop.  You wanted to see what it was like, fine, do
it for a day.  You've done that.  Not for 30 days.  You shouldn't be
doing this.'  And then he was gone.

My rationale in not telling him what I was doing right from the
beginning was sound at first.  Ramadan is not an experiment to him, it's
his life (well, part of it anyway).  The first time we ever talked about
religion and belief, many months ago, he told me that he does not
consider himself religious but that he is definitely spiritual.  When he
told me about Ramadan a few weeks before it began he said that it's the
one month a year that he is a 'good Muslim'.  Clearly a significant time
of the year for him.  Now, he is not the only Muslim in the house, but
as it turns out he is the only one who has actually followed through
with the fasting, so for all intents and purposes it was only him that I
needed to be especially aware of keeping it from.  I didn't want him to
feel like I was trying to take something away from him by making my own
observance, or to otherwise make him uncomfortable.  But by doing that,
a relatively significant part of my experience of Ramadan became about
not letting him know that I was doing it.  And at the point when it
stopped being an experiment for me as well, starting every day worrying
about whether or not I was going to meet him in the kitchen seemed like
a poor use of my brain.  It was time to let the cat out of the bag.

Now I know that to reduce the observance of Ramadan to only the fasting
would be a travesty.  But since that's the most visible manifestation of
the month for me, and the easiest to verbalize, it's what I am (mostly)
going to talk about here.  It's 6:30am on a Saturday (I'm not great at
getting back to sleep after my morning meal), and I've spent the last 45
minutes or so, since his 'Why are you doing this?' trying to put into
words exactly why following through with the entire 30 days of Ramadan
has become so important to me.  The word covenant keeps coming into my
brain, as in 'I've made a covenant' (with myself?  with God?), which
strikes me as a fairly antiquated and melodramatic way of putting
things.  And yet there it is.  And I'm sure I'm putting this very badly,
but please bear with me.

Thursday morning I spent 4 hours in a writing workshop hosted by the
university.  Copious amounts of food and beverages were served.  I sat
at a table with three other people who drank and drank and drank
throughout all of our activities (each cup of coffee perched so
tantalizingly close to my nose on our tiny workspace), and ate and ate
and ate throughout all of our (working) breaks.  Torture!  Inside my
head I was railing against the inconsiderateness of all these
(unknowing) people, and against my own inability to consume.  And then
something snapped.  Something good.  A ferocious little voice inside my
head said 'No one is stopping you, go ahead and eat!'  And, ridiculous
as this probably sounds, I finally understood that fasting was MY
CHOICE.  And that it was important to me.

On the second day of the fast I said 'I prefer to think of it as an
experiment in self-control and empathy, as well as a chance to share,
even superficially, a faith experience of a significant portion of the
world's population.'  What I have learned so far is that it is
impossible to share someone else's faith experience first hand.  Also,
it is impossible to remain at arm's length from your own.  At some point
fairly recently (perhaps with the rearing up of that little voice in my
head!) Ramadan stopped being an experiment for me (which implied
something I am outside of, watching from a distance), and started
being...something else.  Something deeply personal.  Something both
bigger and smaller than I first imagined.

Now the question is, how do I begin to explain that to my friend in the
house?
