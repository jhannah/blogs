<pre style="margin: 0em;">I'm a week into my Ramadan experience, at 11 o'clock on a working Monday
morning, and I'm hungry.  And thirsty.  And tired.  But mostly hungry. 
This has very little to do with Ramadan and very much to do with the 3
days of travel I returned from last night, and the wild storm that blew
through the house into the wee hours sounding like the beasts of hell
descending into my room, keeping me awake.  

As I mentioned last week, travel and menstruation both exempt a person
from fasting, and as a clear indication that god has a sense of humour,
these two exemptions happened to exactly coincide for me.  Meaning I ate
normally Friday through Sunday.  And will not get to eat normally again
for the entire remainder of the month.  Which actually, with the benefit
of today's experience under consideration. is probably a good thing. 
Because it's amazing how quickly your body adapts to changes in
consumption habits!  

When I began this experiment last Monday I was HUNGRY all day.  Tuesday
I was only hungry in the last couple of hours before I could eat again. 
Wednesday and Thursday I didn't even think about food all day.  But here
it is Monday again, with 3 days of food under my belt (quite literally,
I think, in the case of the enormous plate of battered, deep fried,
local muscles I ate for dinner on Stewart Island Saturday), and I'm back
to being HUNGRY again.  Sigh.  They weren't kidding over at the Toronto
Islamic Society (where I went for guidance on what to do and not to do
this month, via their website) when they said that Ramadan is an
exercise in self-control and patience.  I feel like I'm starting all
over again from the beginning today, which I suppose, physiologically
speaking, I probably am.

And so this seems like the perfect time to remind myself that this isn't
about deprivation, but rather about gratitude.  It must be time to think
a bit on all the things I'm grateful for today, rather than on all the
things I'm not eating or drinking.  And so, in no particular order,
here's my list:

#1: I didn't lose my wallet this weekend.  
#2: I survived 2 bumpy flights in a very small plane, and even almost
enjoyed myself in the air.
#3: I managed to drive for hours and hours and hours (in snow and rain
no less!) on the opposite side of the road than I'm used to, without
once going into the wrong lane.
#4: I visited what has to be one of the most beautiful islands on earth.
#5: I completed 2 substantial hikes, in the mud, without totally killing
my (very dodgy) back.
#6: I didn't have to walk back to town in a hail storm.
#7: I had a fabulous travelling buddy who made all of the above
endlessly more enjoyable!
#8: I have the health and freedom to choose to eat or not eat, whenever
I want.
#9: I have family who, upon hearing that I was observing Ramadan this
year, never once asked 'why?' and instead offered only encouragement and
support.
#10: I have work I love to do, which keeps me more than happily busy.

I'm not going to elaborate on all of these right now...spreading them
out a little will give me something to think about later on when it's
normally time for lunch.  Or afternoon tea.  Or...right, back to the
gratitude!  For now, I think the happy story of #1 deserves to be
shared!

I had my wallet all weekend, tramping through the incredible muck of
Stewart Island.  I had it at the airport terminal, where I paid for
parking our rental car over the weekend.  I didn't have it 15 minutes
later, at the gas station where we stopped on our way out of town.  Uh
oh.  I went through the car.  Leanne went through the car.  No wallet
anywhere.  We turned the car around and headed back to the airport.  We
pulled into the parking lot we'd left half an hour before in the pouring
rain, as the sun was setting.  No wallet in the parking space we'd
vacated, or anywhere around it.  We both got out of the car, started
walking towards the terminal down different rows.  Half way to the
terminal I started to seriously panic - my passport (with both my New
Zealand visa and my Korean visa inside), all of my ID, my credit cards,
bank cards, driver's license, everything is in that wallet.  Along with
a couple of hundred dollars in cash since we'd been told there were no
bank machines on Stewart Island (there weren't, but all the shops took
debit cards).  Just before crossing the last stretch before the
terminal, Leanne let out a happy yelp and started jumping up and down. 
My very black wallet had landed on the only yellow patch of paint laid
down in the entire parking lot, and was still there waiting for us with
absolutely everything inside.  What's more, even though the outside was
soaking wet from the rain, inside, everything was bone dry.  Now THAT is
seriously gratitude inspiring!!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

And on that note, I ought to get back to #10, work.  More on #s 2
through 7 sometime soon (I think 8 and 9 are pretty self-explanatory)! 
I hope that you are all happy and healthy and full of gratitude this
fine (stormy) day.  My love to each of you!  R
