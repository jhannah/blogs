<pre style="margin: 0em;">The topic of this evening's English lesson was 'Hang in there!'  As
examples of how to use the idiom correctly, the text book I was using
provided a listening activity where three different people were talking
about their problems learning various languages.  As a follow-up, I
asked the student I was tutoring (though tutoring isn't a very accurate
word for what I do with this extrememly advanced and precocious girl -
banter may be a better description) for some advice on how to study
another language effectively.  Completely deadpan (and without missing a
beat) she told me, 'Well, for starters, you should be less than 7 years
old.'  When I pointed out that she, at 12, and me, at considerably more
than 12, were both well outside her optimal range for language
acquisition, she replied, 'in that case, I guess we'd better just hang
in there, because it's gonna be a whole lot harder for us!'

Later in the lesson, she filled me in on the progress she's been making
towards her goal of getting taller.  A couple of weeks ago she got it
into her head that somehow jumping rope 800 times every day would do the
trick, which left me with distinct memories of a Judy Blume book I read
as a kid ('Are you there God, it's me, Margaret' I think).  To the best
of my recollection, the elbow-swinging 'I must, I must, I must increase
my bust' mantra didn't actually have the desired effect on the character
in Blume's book, and predictably neither has the jump rope routine led
to any perceptible height increases for my student in the last 14 days. 
What it has done, however, is to lower the girl's weight by 2 kilograms
- something that she's very, very happy about.  And I am not.

This girl is a perfectly normal 12 year old.  None of the North American
euphemisms for being overweight (even a little) apply to this kid.  She
is not chubby or chunky or ample or big or hefty or husky or plumpish or
pudgy or round or stout or tubby or zaftig (which, incidentally, is a
really great word...zaftig).  Not in the least.  What she is is petite
(both in width and height), not surprisingly considering her two petite
parents, and smart, and healthy.  And, apparently in her mind, still 1
kg heavier than she ought to be.  

In a Chinese newspaper I was reading a couple of weeks ago (just before
this jump rope fetish started), there was an article about the physical
condition of approximately 7000 university students in Beijing.  In
China, all students hoping to enter university (or any other new level
of schooling, from middle school up) must go through an examination of
their physical condition before admission, and then again just as they
finish up in order to enter the professional job market.  Which means
that the country has pretty good stats on the changing shape of young
people.

According to the article, less than half a percent of all students
taking the professional physical achieved an excellent rating.  46% of
all students failed the test entirely.  This is the test that measures
things like how many sit-ups you can do in a minute, and how flexible
you are, and how fast you can run a specified distance.  Not stellar
results (I wonder what they'd be in North America?).  More worrying to
the analysts though, was that a huge proportion of both male and female
students were not at healthy weights - a key indicator of future medical
expenditures.  According to the tests, 27% of all male students were
OVERweight.  And 40% of all female students were UNDERweight.  And it
got worse...the same trends could be seen on physical examinations at
every level of schooling beginning in middle school, except the younger
the students were the more exaggerated the gap between them was.  So
proportionally the most number of overweight males in the pool are the
youngest boys, and the most number of underweight females are the
youngest girls.  Yikes!

Now, I know a thing or two about not being at an ideal weight.  I've
spent over half my life either actively dieting or feeling guilty about
not dieting more actively.  About 90% of the time (currently) when I
look in a mirror my first reaction is 'YIKES!', an unhelpful sentiment
that is not greatly aided by the reckless abandon many Koreans use in
telling others exactly what they think about them ('You look so tired
and sick today,' for example, or 'You have an enormous pimple on the end
of your nose,' or 'You're really fat').  In my case this reaction is
exacerbated by the fact that, thanks in large part to a persistent
intestinal disorder I carried around for the first few years I was here
but thankfully no longer have, I was once (in the not too distant past)
A LOT smaller than I am now.  In fact, for a brief period, about HALF of
what I am now.  I walk around in New Zealand, not precisely satisfied
with my body, but at least not at all out war with it.  I can find
clothes that fit me (and look good), shopkeepers don't immediately chase
me out of their stores.  People talk about the weather or school or what
happened on Masterchef last night, not about my need to lose weight.  I
walk every day and go to the pool, workout in the pilates studio, go
entire days without thinking about my size or what it says about me to
others, feel pretty good about myself (physically, I mean...thank
heavens I've never had any problem with negative chatter about other
parts of my being!).  And then I come back here and am feeling like a
whale again within about 48 hours (and who wants to go workout when they
feel like everyone is constantly judging them?).  I know this negative
chatter in my brain does nothing to help the weight-loss process (and
unlike my student, I really could stand to jump rope a few hundred times
a day...), nor does it help make me more productive in any other area of
my life.  Which is why I really hate to see someone like this perfectly
healthy, beautiful, witty, smart, lovely 12 year old already learning
how to hate her body.  How do we stop her (and so many like her) from
becoming that 40% of underweight women (which exists in Korea as well),
or one of the countless women (like me) who ought to be perfectly
thrilled with their lives but instead spend untold brain energy judging
themselves instead?

I told my student that if all of her energy goes into trying to get
skinnier, then there'll be nothing left to go into making her taller. 
She thought about this for a minute or two, agreed that might be true,
and then switched back to our conversation about language study.  'I
suppose if you think you can, then you will,' she said, about learning
to speak another language.  'But it'll still be A LOT harder for old
people,' she added, looking pointedly at me and the Korean books in
front of me, 'so you'll REALLY need to hang in there well.'
