<pre style="margin: 0em;">I've been living in the same city in Korea for almost eight years -
longer than I've been in one place other than my hometown ever, in my
whole life. And even my hometown is a record that I'm closing in on - I
was there for just 10 years before heading off to university. Which is
to say that I consider this place home, as much as any place ever has
been. This city and this country - I am a local here.

Except that I'm not. No matter how local I feel, I will always be a
foreigner here.

Woman at lunch: 'Wow! You eat Korean food very well!' Me: 'I love Korean
food.' Her: 'You know what that is?' Me, taking a little more of a very
common side dish: 'Yes, I have been here for a long time.' Her: 'But
most Foreigners don't eat Korean food well!' Me: 'I think you don't go
out with many foreigners. Most of the people I know like Korean food
very much.' Pause, eating. Her: 'Wow! You even eat that?! Do you know
what that is?' Me: 'You've got to stop being shocked every time I put
something in my mouth. Really, I like Korean food. I've been eating it
for a long time.' Her: 'But you are a foreigner! Foreigners don't like
Korean food.' And so on, and so on. 

Not too much surprises me in Changwon anymore. I know how the city, the
first planned one in the country, came to be imagined and then built. I
know where the good restaurants are - the ones that only locals know
about. I know which days the traditional markets are in which locations.
I know how to get from here to there and from there to here and how to
give other people directions to all those places. I work, pay taxes,
even vote (if I want to). Changwon is not a curiosity, it's where I
live. It's my home.

But the other day, walking from home to a store on the other side of
town, I went through the road-side stalls of one of the traditional
markets. These markets are held every 5 (or so) days, on dates that end
in a particular number (for example, the market downtown that I usually
frequent is held every 4, 9, 14, 19, 24 and 29 of the month). This
market is on 1s and 6s, in an older residential neighbourhood and has a
grittier feel than 'mine'. As I was getting near the end, after the
usual noodle makers and flower sellers, fruit vendors and snack stalls,
I happened past a woman portioning out an animal carcass with a big
cleaver at a folding card table. As you would expect, all of the hair
had already been removed and the body was clean and smooth, the head
already severed, lying to one side. At first I thought it was a pig - a
very common sight in markets - but then it occurred to me that for a pig
it was very, very small. I took a closer look, just as the woman began
hacking off a back leg for a waiting customer, and saw that the animal
was a dog. Whoa, foreigner again.

Now, the fact that Koreans sometimes eat dog meat is well known. In
fact, I have eaten it myself on more than one occasion. Done well, the
soup is rich and flavourful, and very, very expensive. This is not the
family pet we're talking about. They're dogs bred specifically for
eating, much as we breed pigs or chickens to eat. The soup is considered
a kind of food-medicine, particularly good for men. It used to be much
more common than it is now - a lot of my students (the first generation
raised with pet dogs at home and unable or unwilling to make the
distinction between them) have never had it, and finding dog-soup
restaurants has become more and more difficult, even during my time in
Korea. Which is why I was especially taken aback by the dog in the
market. 

Professor in passenger seat, driving back from departmental outing on an
island a couple of hours away: &quot;How do you drive in Korea?&quot; Me: &quot; What
do you mean?&quot; Him: &quot;How do you know where to go?&quot; Me: &quot;I've lived here
for a long time.&quot; Him: &quot;But you are a foreigner.&quot; Me: &quot;The signs are in
English and Korean.&quot; Him: &quot;But you are a foreigner.&quot; And so on, and so
on.

Stopping at a roadside rest area for breakfast, same drive. Him, taking
my arm: &quot;Come, let's take a shit together.&quot; Me: &quot;Excuse me??&quot; Him,
pulling me to an empty table behind the counter: &quot;A shit, let's take a
shit.&quot; Me, mentally: &quot;Oh, SEAT! He wants us to take a SEAT together.&quot;
Yup, still a foreigner. No matter how long I stay.

Climbing the mountain behind my house this morning, I came across a
super shiny, black worm with a distinct hammer-shaped head. Something I
had never seen before, despite climbing that particular trail possibly
hundreds of times in the last 8 years. At home, after finding an exact
photo with my first google search for 'hammerhead worm', I learned that
it's a species common to this part of Asia. And that it's the only kind
of worm that exclusively eats other worms, by (seriously disgusting!)
dissolving them. Usually they're nocturnal, which I guess is why I've
never come across one before, but there's no shortage of them around.
They can survive blistering heat and freezing cold (both of which we
have in abundance throughout the year), and if you try to kill them by
squashing them or cutting them up (I don't want to know how people
discovered this) each separate piece just becomes its own little worm.
Wow. Now that's something awesome to discover in your own backyard! 

Strange new (common) worm, oh right, I'm a foreigner! Instead of
thinking of it as an insult, I'm just going to remind myself that being
foreign is also another way of saying, 'living in a perpetual state of
newness, astonishment and awe.' And who could complain about that?
