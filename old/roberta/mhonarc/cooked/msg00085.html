<pre style="margin: 0em;">Yesterday was Persian New Year - Happy Nowruz! I hope that the year 1390
is good to us all! 

Among other places, Persian New Year is celebrated in Iran. How
embarassing is it that a few months ago, I, who am an International
Relations professor and not generally a completely dumb person, didn't
know that most Iranians are Persian. Or that the main language of Iran
is Persian. Or that Persian and Farsi are the same thing. I'm not sure
I'd actually considered WHAT the people of Iran might be called (other
than Iranian), because truth be told, I'd never thought much about Iran
at all. I was quite content for my knowledge of that part of the world
to be limited to what I 'learned' from the 1991 movie 'Not Without My
Daughter' (whose uncritical reception into my brain I am blaming on my
youth when I watched it), and what the ongoing procession of news
stories about Iran say in the media I most commonly watch (the NY times,
CBC, BBC, NZHerald).

I guess a person can't be interested in EVERYwhere ALL the time. It's
reasonable to think that each of us has a sort of awareness radius that
is tuned to certain places and certain people at certain times,
depending on our experience. So it's not my general lack of knowledge of
things Persian that troubles me. It's how easily I allowed what
knowledge I had to be bounded by those extremely limited sources listed
above. How I never, not for even one story that I read about crazy Iran
and its crazy leader, stopped to ask the question 'What's so crazy about
them?' or to look a little deeper than the paper in my hands. 

And I should know better than to generalize people that way. When I
first came to Korea, my best friend was (is) a man who had lived and
travelled throughout Asia for several years. I would go visit him, thumb
through his masses of photos, and he would ask me where I thought a
particular picture was taken. I learned pretty quickly to always answer
China. Even though I had never imagined that one country could contain
even a fraction of the magnificence and diversity that I saw in the
various prints. How had I never known this before, I wondered, that
China is such an incredible country? How had I never ached to go there
and discover it for myself? The first vacation I got I took a boat to
China, and have been fully enamored ever since. 

The news I read about China is pretty much never right. MY China, and
the China in newspapers, don't have a whole lot in common. This is
something I've come to expect, and to make adjustments for when adding
to the big China file in my brain. Which is not to say that China
doesn't have any problems - of course it does! Just that it pays to try
to keep the big picture in mind when considering what I read.

And don't even get me started on Korea! I live in a very modern and cozy
two-bedroom apartment on a quiet residential street in a city whose
standard of living is easily the highest of any I have ever lived in. I
went to the doctor this afternoon, a doctor who completed his residency
at Harvard, in a state-of-the-art private hospital that would turn any
of the Canadian or American or Kiwi doctors I know green with envy. And
it cost me $5 for the medicine I was prescribed. Afterwards I got a tall
Chai from an upscale coffee chain to soothe my throat and browsed a
selection of multi-lingual books that I might have wanted to read in bed
later, before taking a luxury taxi home (for $3.50). There is nowhere in
town I wouldn't walk in, alone, at any time of the day or night. And my
grad school colleagues back in Canada (IR majors all) once had an
earnest discussion about whether I was living in a more dangerous
country or whether that 'honour' fell to our classmate busy starting an
NGO for refugee children in a camp in Palestine that was mortared at
least once a day. This is what happens when you take the news too
seriously. You forget that places are real, and that people everywhere
are just people, like you. Both more and less than any 60 second news
story you could ever read about them.

Somehow, however, these revelations about one part of the world never
managed to penetrate that part of my brain responsible for thinking
about other parts of the world. And this is a problem because I teach
about the world for a living. 

One of my flatmates in New Zealand, where I study when I'm not at work
in Korea, is from Iran. He seemed nice enough right from the beginning,
but my first inkling that things were probably not as I had imagined
them in his home country came the morning he was telling me about this
Canadian TV show that ALL his friends used to watch back home. This
REALLY popular show in Iran, called 'Due South'. You could have knocked
me over with a feather that entire day...of all the shows he might have
mentioned, the cheesy mid-90s comedy/drama about a ridiculously polite
mountie in Chicago was definitely not the one I was expecting. We had
fun trying to remember all the characters names together (though really,
who cares to name anyone except that beautiful dog Diefenbaker?), and
laughing at the absurdity of that shared connection. It turned out to be
the first of many connections.

Aside from TV shows, our family lives also have much in common. And our
childhoods. The paths of our educations. Even our cats look alike. His
family is Muslim, mine is Christian, and I had no idea whatseoever that
that would make as little difference as it does to what we think, and
dream and do. He shows me pictures of Iran with the same enthusiasm that
my friend in Korea used to show me pictures of China, before I'd become
as enthralled with it as he is. And I feel that same sense of absolute
wonder imagining all the possibilities there. Iran is a place that's
going to be as important to me in its own way as China already is, and
probably for the same reason - because it has opened my mind and made my
world infinitely bigger.

Now that I'm paying attention, I hear a lot of different people make a
lot of different comments about Iran on a pretty regular basis. People
who, like me, should know better. That China is the great economic and
imperial worry of North America and Iran the religious is pretty
accepted rhetoric. Which makes it pretty okay in a lot of different
circumstances to make disparaging comments about, based on very little
actual knowledge. Now that the face of Iran has shrunk for me, from a
featureless mass (that I wasn't afraid of, exactly, but certainly wasn't
rushing out to get to know better) to a single real individual, I find
these comments hurtful. And want to do what I can to help other people
think beyond them as well.

I gave a presentation about Iran in my classes the other day, as an
example for my students about looking beyond the news when talking about
places. I started with a slide show of pictures from various places in
Iran, and asked everyone what country they thought I would be talking
about. Knowing my history, the first guesses were predictably Canada and
New Zealand. When they saw a photo of the capital in winter, the
majority decided that it was in fact Bern, Switzerland. The sense of
wonder on their faces when they discovered that the snowy city was
Tehran and that it is smack in the middle of the imagined desert of the
middle east gave me a glimpse of the wonder I feel every time I learn
something new about Iran. 4 distinct seasons were the beginning for me
too. Followed by fields of fragrant roses. Pistachio farms. The
birthplace of Shiraz and polo. Some of the world's best caviar. A
consolidated history going back almost 5000 years! Comparing some of
that history of Iran with some of the history of Korea made it very easy
for my students to contextualize what they were learning, and, some of
them told me later, made the place seem real to them for the first time.
 I can relate...'Due South' did it for me.  And who knows how many more
worlds will open up from here?
