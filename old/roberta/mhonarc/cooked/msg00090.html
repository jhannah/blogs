<pre style="margin: 0em;">I am not Jewish.  And neither are my friends Sue, Ron or Tessa.  And yet
the four of us got together last night for a Shabat dinner - the Jewish
custom which ends the work week and prepares everyone for the sabbath
ahead.  2 atheists, an agnostic and a christian.  

Sue was married to a Jewish man for about 31 years, though she never
converted and never learned the prayers.  She just spent a horrific (and
by horrific, I mean - OMG!!!) 10 days in the hospital after slipping on
the ice and breaking her leg into tiny little pieces, and had a yen to
repeat a tradition she'd practiced for so long and lost touch with upon
her return home.  We were all inclined to support her, even if we didn't
have any idea what to do.  Ron grew up on a 'secular kibbutz' in Israel.
 He didn't know the prayers, but did have a friend in the local
synagogue who lent him a hebrew bible and explained what to do.  I lit
the candles.  He read the prayers in Hebrew and then explained them in
English (as much for his own benefit as ours I think!).  Cut the bread. 
Tessa served the food.  It didn't feel like a bunch of people with no
clue playing at religion - it felt warm and close and blessed.  Sue was
smiling, we were all smiling.  And I suppose God meets us wherever we
are, however we come to the table.

Sue's experience in the hospital makes me hope that I NEVER need medical
care in New Zealand.  Saving you most of the gory details, let me
suffice by saying that her multiple displaced fractures and dislocations
did not qualify her as an emergency, despite the fact that the bones
continued to move around and further pulverize themselves inside her
busted leg for the entire 6 DAYS that it took them to get her into
surgery.  At which point the damage was so extensive that she required a
second surgery 3 days later to finish the job.  She now has more metal
in her leg than leg in her leg.  Ouch!  

In other news, kapiti ice-cream is just as luciously creamy and
deliciously wonderful as I recall from last year when I was here. 
Carmelized pear and ginger, manuka honey and fig...now THAT's ice-cream!
 This winter's weather has been much milder than last, meaning the green
grass and hearty roses blooming around town make me feel as if I'm
living in a perpetual state of spring (when ice-cream consumption is not
completely ridiculous).  I've learned that there are no squirrels in New
Zealand, which I find endlessly strange and fascinating, but that there
is another plague of rabbits sweeping across the island.

My PhD is officially in progress now, and I actually feel glimmers of
proficiency from time to time (unlike last year's panic attacks!).  I
spend most of most days in my shared office, reading, writing, chatting
with colleagues, and checking my email 8000 times.  It's a sweet life! 
When I'm not in my office, I'm wandering about the countryside soaking
in the wide open spaces and strange familiarity (so much looks so much
like Canada!).  Unlike last year when I arrived not knowing a soul, this
time I have a great network of friends which makes things MUCH less
lonely (though possibly also much less productive in absolute writing
terms!).  My committee continues to be great, and things are moving
along.

There is much, much more to say, but my stomach is telling me that I
forgot to eat lunch today after wandering through the farmer's market. 
Now that it's nearly 3pm, the voices are getting lively down there!!  So
I will save the next musings for another message... hope you are all
well and happy, wherever you are!!  Much love to you all!  R
