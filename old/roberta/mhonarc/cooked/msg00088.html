<pre style="margin: 0em;">When I got into my office yesterday morning, the first thing I noticed
was a ziploc bag on my officemate's desk labelled 'FEMUR' in bold, black
letters.  Stepping over to have a closer look, I saw that it did infact
contain a bone, about 10 cm long.  Since her last book (my officemate is
a distinguished emeritus professor) was about the history of a kiwi
confection (the much adored pavlova), it's easy to forget that she is in
fact an archaeologist.  And deals with bones a lot, for a living.

Yesterday afternoon, another student stopped me as I was heading out of
the building for a spinal x-ray.  'For yourself, or for a subject?' he
asked.  Reminder number two that I am surrounded by archaeologists.

The anthropology department at Otago includes both archaeology and
social anthropology (or 'so-sh' - soc - as we're usually called). 
Although archaeology is nowhere on the official letterhead, they
outnumber us soc people by about 3-1.  Meaning we pretty often have, um,
unusual things lying around.  Like massive muddy toolkits.  Bones.  Tiny
bags full of endless pieces of broken ceramics.  The list is pretty
endless.  The environmentally controlled door at the end of my corridor
leads to the 'Ancient DNA lab,' beside which is a room full of
rubbermaid containers stacked with flaked stone tools (some ancient, and
some 'recreated' by students).  And discussion around the lunch table
often includes topics like how the theory of 'Optimal Foraging Distance'
factors into whether we should walk to the ice-cream shop on the corner
for dessert despite the constant rain or stay dry in the tea room and
suck on old sugar cubes instead.  Or how incredible it must have been to
be one of those first Polynesian people who came across to New Zealand
in a flimsy canoe, only to discover that the weather was horrible and
the entire place was full of (pardon my language, this is a direct
quote...) 'Fuck-big chickens' (aka: Moa).  I LOVE academia!!

But all work and no play...well you know.  So, on Sunday night, Anne
drove me to Pilot's beach to see the Little Blue Penguins. 45 minutes
each way on a very narrow, very windy road along the harbour coast of
the peninsula...can you say car-sick??  And BEAUtiful!  The beach is a
tiny crescent of sand at the base of Taieroa Head, which is the rocky
hump of land at the very end of the penisula home to a (protected)
colony of Royal Albatross and a whole lot of shags (those are birds too,
I think).  As we climbed the hundred meters or so of stairs down to the
viewpoint just above the water, an albatross lazily rode the wind
currents above, all 3 meters of his wingspan stretched out and
magnificent*.  (*Authors note: I feel that as an Otago resident, I have
to use words like 'magnificent' to describe Albatross, which are
practically a local obsession.  Truth be told, however, although the
concept of a bird with a wingspan so large it can only take off in
gale-force winds is interesting, I think they look like overgrown
seagulls and am not very enamored of them in general.  I much prefer
looking for possums on the fenceposts around Taieroa Head, which are big
furry things that look like a cross between a house cat and a raccoon,
even though people here think they're evil - mostly for doing things
like eating albatross eggs - and do their best to kill and make socks
out of them.)

Little Blues are very different than the Yellow-Eyeds I'm used to
seeing, and although they're much more common I hadn't managed to see
one in all of my three visits to Dunedin before.  Instead of coming
ashore one at a time, they group together in the water in 'rafts' and
then once critical mass is reached they make a break for the beach and
swarm up all at once.  Incredible.  The speed at which they move in the
water is amazing, and then there they are on land, waddling as fast as
their tiny legs will carry them.  And at 20cm total height full grown, I
do mean TINY legs!  I could hazard a guess as to why they're called
little BLUE penguins, but the truth is that since they only come ashore
at dusk, by the time they went by me it was so dark they might have been
wearing neon t-shirts with 'Welcome to New Zealand!' printed on them and
I wouldn't have had the faintest clue.  It was the rustling sound of
their dragging tails in the grass that mostly tipped you off if one was
near, or the red light of the special volunteer flashlights (bright
lights scare them, but apparently they're colour blind?) outlining their
squid-full bellies.  Lucky for me, said red light was so busy pulling
everyone else away to a little group shuffling along the viewpoint fence
that Anne and I had the loner taking the back way home all to
ourselves...so close that it almost walked right over my foot (I'm
pretty sure that one wasn't wearing a t-shirt, though I wouldn't rule a
tuxedo entirely out of the question).

On an unrelated topic, it seems that this old listserv is still
functional afterall, since I did get a reply or two to my message last
week.  And I don't think I've updated the membership to it since it was
first created...a LONG time ago.  So if you're getting these messages
and would prefer not to, please let me know and I'll remove you from the
list (if I can work out how...remember, I've never done ANYthing with
the members lists before!).  Of course the opposite is true too, so if
I'm missing you (in which case I assume someone kindly passed this
along) and want to be included then I can add your name.

I hope that you are all well and happy, wherever you are.  Much love. 
Roberta
