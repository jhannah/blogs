<pre style="margin: 0em;">Only in New Zealand do they talk about 'outbreaks' of weather, as if
snow were some kind of disease.  Though for as often as most of the
country gets snow, I suppose the comparison may be a fair one.  When I
arrived back in Dunedin in June, the mountain resorts were going crazy
because of the complete lack of snow.  The opening of every skifield in
the country was delayed by at least a month, and in some cases
significantly longer.  We had the warmest, driest June on record ever
here in town, and for most of July also enjoyed sunny skies and calm.  

And then, right near the end of the month, we got thumped.  A massive
storm dumped more snow on Dunedin than had fallen in 17 years. 
Everything shut down.  A sense of wonder pervaded the city.  My
flatmates and I (some of whom had never seen snow before in their lives)
made the most enormous snowman imagineable.  Everywhere you went, people
were laughing and playing and taking pictures of the magic.  Now, only 3
weeks later, we're in the middle of a 'once in 50 years outbreak' and
people aren't so happy about th snow.  For one thing, thanks to the gale
force winds accompanying this storm, it feels a whole lot colder than
the last storm.  For another, a once-in-17-years snow break seems like a
gift but a twice-in-a-month snow break seems ominous.  People wonder if
the weather is actually changing, and this is just the start of things
to come.  24-hours into the storm, it's still alternately hailing,
snowing and raining in quick succession, all driven by a truly ferocious
wind.

Inside the house, life is much more settled than what's raging on
outside.  After Saturday morning's uncomfortable kitchen encounter, my
flatmate and I had a looooong talk and helped each other understand
where we each are coming from.  He still thinks I am stubborn (funny,
he's not the only person who has called me that, and I'm not sure it's
entirely complimentary!), but when he'd taken the trouble to prepare my
favourite rice and boil the kettle for my tea Sunday morning before I'd
even come downstairs I knew I was in the clear with him.  Later, when we
were doing our traditional weekly grocery run, it was fun to have
someone else along who stared as longingly at the vast shelves of food
as I'm sure I have been - nothing to make a not-otherwise-hungry person
salivate like a trip to the supermarket!  He checks in on me
periodically, I check in on him.  Though Ramadan remains an intensely
personal experience for each of us, having someone in the house to share
some of the journey with has made all the difference.

Thank you all for sharing the journey with me as well.  I hope that each
of you is well and warm and happy, where ever you are!  Much love -
Roberta
