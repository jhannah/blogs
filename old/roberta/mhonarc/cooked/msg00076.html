<pre style="margin: 0em;">3 weeks into Ramadan, and I can officially remove every pair of pants I
own without undoing any of their buttons.  I don't think I've lost much
weight, but apparently just enough to change the way things fit.  Hm. 
Probably should have anticipated this, but didn't.  Which brings me to a
few observations on the practical side of fasting.  

I just met another international student for the first time, at the
request of the international office on campus.  She's from the same
general section of planet as me (the west part of N. America), we have
quite a lot in common, she's having a bit of trouble settling into town
and the international advisors thought we'd get along.  And so we did. 
Except that throughout a significant portion of our 90 minute
conversation, over (her) coffee, I was thinking about how I was having
trouble really focussing on what she was saying.  And how hungry the
smell of her coffee and biscotti were making me.  Lesson: it gets
progressively harder to think about anything other than feeding myself
throughout the day - better to plan meetings early!

A certain level of normal activity is fine, but in addition to becoming
a space cadet each afternoon, my body also doesn't have the same
get-up-and-go that it's used to.  I still walk quite a bit, work, play
on the wheel in the pottery studio, go out with friends.  But no matter
how much I'd like to, swimming+fasting is not a particularly good idea. 
I only tried it once, which is probably not a fair sample, but ... wow. 
It's easy to forget how much water our bodies lose while exercising in
water until trying to do it without the benefit of a handy water bottle
(and snacks!) waiting at the pool edge.  I tried to time my swim to be
as near the end of the day's fasting as possible, but that just meant
that the whole getting out, getting dry, getting home, getting fed
routine was WAY more effort than is probably healthy for a person. 
Ditto other strenuous workouts (or too much time on my feet in general).
 A good part of Ramadan turns out to be learning to balance energy and
output, which means prioritizing the things that really need to be done
and letting some of the other things wait a month.  All in all, not a
bad lesson to learn, especially for someone like me who tends towards
perpetual (but not always purposeful) motion.

Dehydration/rehydration is another thing.  This hasn't been the issue
that I expected when I started fasting, ie. feeling parched all the
time.  It's certainly not an issue here like it must be anywhere not
blessed with a steady temperature of about 10C and relatively short
days.  Imagine fasting in northern Canada right now, where an hour
before daylight is something like 2:30 am and sundown isn't until after
11.  Or in Iran, which has long days AND high temperatures.  Or in
Korea, which has high temperatures and ridiculous humidity.  And yes,
I'm pretty sure that there are people faithfully observing Ramadan in
all of those places right now.  And I am truly humbled by their
dedication.  For me however it's not the slightly hollow, achey feeling
in my stomach or the slightly bitter tackiness in my mouth that's the
problem (I got used to both of those things fairly early on, though have
often lamented not being able to swallow a breath freshener during the
day!), but rather figuring out how to spread out my liquid intake over
the hours available so that I don't have to pee every 15 minutes while
trying to get to sleep.  Which is really annoying and really disruptive
of normal sleeping patterns.  Which is next on my list.

Sleeping.  As I mentioned in an earlier post, I'm not all that good at
falling asleep again after waking up early for pre-dawn breakfast. 
Also, being aware that I need to get up earlier than usual often wakes
me up during the night...oh no...I've slept through my alarm...reach for
watch...see that it's only 2:48, 54 minutes since the last time I
looked...drift back to fitful sleep.  And I'm a person who needs sleep. 
A lot of sleep.  I function best on between 8 and 10 hours a night
usually.  So functioning on 5 or 6 hours of not-that-great sleep has had
a much bigger impact that the actual going without food or drink. 
Though I think that I may actually be getting used to this new schedule
now...3 mornings in a row I've managed to get back to dreamland before
getting on with my day!

Stomach noises are something else.  Also, the timing of cooking so that
food is ready to eat at the appropriate hour without requiring too much
contact time with it before I can eat it.  And I wouldn't recommend
baking during the daytime, unless you're awfully confident with your
recipe, because it's hard to keep fingers out of bowls to check on the
progress of things.  I ruined two batches of icing in a row yesterday
because I didn't sample it to check how it was coming along.  The cake,
however, I am happy to report turned out just fine!

I have plenty of observations on the less mundane side of the experience
as well, but at the moment (45 minutes until sundown, roughly), am
having trouble focussing on anything at all other than the incremental
movement of the sun in the sky, and how eager I am for dinner tonight. 
Clearly those are thoughts for a more lucid time of day!  So for now
I'll just say goodnight...blessings to each of you...I hope you are
well.
