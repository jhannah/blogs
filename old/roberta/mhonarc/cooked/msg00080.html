<pre style="margin: 0em;">What business does a Christian girl from the Canadian prairies have
attempting to observe Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting?  Probably
none.  And yet, here I am in New Zealand, doing just that.  From an hour
or so before the sun rises to sometime shortly after sundown, for the
next 28 days (give or take a few days for travel and menstruation, both
of which temporarily exempt me from fasting), I will not be eating or
drinking anything.  Not even water.  

In light of the fact that Ramadan is not only (or even mostly) about
deprivation, while I'm at it I'm going to try to be more mindful of
other people, and of God, and of myself.  Decreased food consumption,
increased mindfulness - a kind of package deal.  There are myriad
lessons that abstaining from food (and other things!) during the month
is supposed to teach a person - not the least of which is patience,
something which I surely could (always!) use a refresher on.  Ditto
perseverance.  It's supposed to help clear your mind (what PhD student
doesn't need that?!), give you greater empathy for the poor (hunger and
thirst suck, so let's help those who don't get to change that condition
once the sun sets), erase divisions (everyone, regardless of social
status, gender, or nationality observes the fast together), and promote
sincerity (no one can really tell if you're following your fast or not,
so it's all up to you).  It's also an acknowledgement of the gifts of
Allah in the world, and regardless of whether or not you are a
particular believer, it seems to me a good idea to stop every now and
again and really be thankful for how bountiful the world we live in is.  

To be clear, I'm not converting to Islam (not that there would be
anything wrong with that if I did).  I prefer to think of it as an
experiment in self-control and empathy, as well as a chance to share,
even superficially, a faith experience of a significant portion of the
world's population.  This is not wholly unlike the two weeks I spent in
silence at a Buddhist meditation retreat in Thailand a few years ago. 
Different deprivations, similar aims.  I wish I could say that I went to
that retreat out of a pure and sincere devotion to spiritual
development, but actually I went because a friend bet me that I couldn't
keep my mouth shut for so long (he was wrong).  Similarly, I wish I
could say that I am embarking on this journey with a pure and sincere
devotion to spiritual development, but really it's as much curiosity as
anything.  I'm curious about this foundational experience that so many
people around the world share, and also curious about whether or not I
can actually get through a whole month without eating or drinking (two
things which are very dear to my heart, especially here in hyper-social
Dunedin) during daylight hours.  Also,  to be perfectly honest, I'm a
practical sort of person and figured that if I'm ever going to have a
serious go at observing an entire month of fasting, it ought to be here
in the middle of a New Zealand winter when the temperature throughout
the relatively short daylight hours is neither too hot nor too cold.  If
there were ever going to be ideal conditions for an experiment such as
this, these are them.      

Now, disclaimer aside, I do think that more will come of this month than
the satisfaction of my curiosity.  Though I hated pretty much every
single minute of my 2-weeks of silence, and swore that I would never do
anything so ridiculous (for me - understand that I am not calling the
practice itself ridiculous...) again, it turns out in the end that I
actually learned an awful lot at that retreat.  Things that I still
practice, or think about, today.  There is no question in my mind now
that I actually learned some important lessons sitting there under the
palm trees with the monks, such that I look back on the whole experience
almost fondly and have even considered going back.  I could not have
imagined, even in the middle of that experience, what would come of what
I learned.  Likewise, I have no idea what will come of what I undertake
this month.  But I firmly believe that when people step out in faith
(even in misguided or selfish faith), we do not step out alone.  God
(whatever god you conceive) meets us.  The world meets us.  We meet our
(better) selves.

Which brings me back to the present, with the sun just beginning to dip
behind the hills ringing my horizon, preparing to break my fast for the
(second) day.  One of the best things about Ramadan, in my estimation,
is how social it is - how you join with your friends and family at the
end of the day to celebrate your abundance together.  Unsure of how it
would make my (very dear) Muslim friends here feel to have someone like
me essentially tagging along for the ride during their holiest month, I
haven't told anyone here what I'm doing.  Instead, I'm telling you.  And
hoping that, fast or not, you will share my enormous gratitude tonight
(and all this month) for the tremendous abundance we are so blessed with
- an abundance of which each of you are very much a part.
