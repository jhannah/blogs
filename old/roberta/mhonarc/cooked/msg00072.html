<pre style="margin: 0em;">If sometimes it seems that time passes much too quickly, disappearing
into an abyss of 'then' within which it is difficult to pinpoint exactly
what happened to all of those millions of seconds, minutes, hours, days,
there are other times that are so impossibly rich and full that those
same seconds, minutes, hours, days no longer seem relevant.  Time out of
time.  

This morning was bright and grey and rainy.  Gray as far as the eye
could see, fat drops splattering in random intervals, but the landscape
suffused with light rather than dull as rainy days usually are.  It was
beautiful.  A few hours later the sky was a patchwork of clear and
cloud.  A few hours after that it was nothing but blue and properly hot
for the first time since I returned to Dunedin a week ago.  I gave up my
pretense of work and went for a walk in the gardens.

I feel eternally blessed to have New Zealand's oldest botanical gardens
literally across the street from my home here.  And for all the dozens
of hours I have spent wandering its grounds (with varying levels of
intensity and purpose), it's amazing to me how often I am still
surprised by it.  Not only by the constant shifting of the trees and
plants from day to day and season to season, nor by the movement of wild
(and not so wild!) birds and other creatures, but by entire sections of
garden that somehow in all of my meanderings I have never before managed
to find.  For example, the mediterranean garden that I stumbled upon
today, up on the hill almost perfectly in the center of everything,
symmetrical stone terrace surrounded by candy-scented bushes in soft
shades of silvery green, punctuated by perfectly pruned cypresses like
exclamation marks at each corner.  One striking bush had needles like an
evergreen but tiny blue clusters of flowers that looked and smelled
suspiciously like sweet peas, one of my favourite plants in gardens in
Canada.  Inhaling their sweet fragrance took me back to all of the many
bouquets of sweet peas I've had over the years, tucked into Kerr jars on
kitchen tables in all of the places I ever lived before leaving the
country.  Delightful!  

The mediterranean garden is just down the path from the Australian
garden that I used to like jogging through at daybreak (back when I did
things like jog at daybreak).  In the frosty air, the eucalyptus oil
cleared my lungs and made it easier to breathe.  In today's humidity,
the scent was only evident when I rubbed a leaf between my fingers, and
rather than clearing my lungs it reminded me of a distant afternoon lost
in a thick fog (literal, not figurative!) in the southwestern Chinese
countryside in which I happened to pass through a large grove of
eucalyptus trees.  With so few visual cues to focus on, the smell was
powerful.  And comforting.  Amidst all the unknown around me, buried in
the mist, eucalyptus was something I knew.  Not long after the path
cleared and I found myself right at the edge of the very place I had
been trying all along to find, and I've barely thought of it since. 
Until today.  Canadian kitchen tables and walks through the Chinese
countryside all in the span of a few footsteps in the garden.  Time out
of time.

One of my old flatmates, a wonderful Botswanan woman who has since
returned to her African home, never, ever, ever walked in the garden. 
Such a loss!  The trees frightened her.  Day or night, rain or shine,
she was convinced the place was unsafe and did everything she could to
avoid it.  Since it is the trees that make me feel most at home in this
part of town, I always found this hard to understand.  Trees make me
feel grounded, less distracted, calm.  I guess this is what happens when
you grow up (essentially) in the forest, versus when you grow up on the
plains like she did.  Different people, different sense of place.

I taught a food course in Changwon this semester, in which we looked at
different international issues through the lens of specific parts of the
food system.  In a survey of my students, only two out of around 60 had
ever grown anything on their own.  Not a garden.  Not a flower.  Not so
much as a bean seed in a plastic cup.  So I shouldn't have been
surprised that they were totally disconnected from the land (as I think
of it).  One group, preparing an assigned class presentation on the
documentary 'Dirt!' called me repeatedly looking for help in making a
connection between their film and food.  'Well, food comes from dirt,' I
tried the first time, 'you know, it grows in the ground.'  The second
time I tried 'plants need dirt to live and a lot of food either IS
plants or EATS plants.  Which grow in the ground.  Which is made of
dirt.'  The third time I knew I had a real problem.  It wasn't a
language problem, it was a conceptual problem.  Having grown up in
cement high rises, homes, schools, offices, entertainment, it was hard
for them to grasp the connection between land and life.  Different
people, different sense of place.

I hope I never lose my sense of awe in green and growing things, my
ability to step outside of time among them and calm my chaotic mind, to
feel that with days like these life is full indeed.  And I hope that you
also find times and places to lose yourself...and to find yourself there
again!
