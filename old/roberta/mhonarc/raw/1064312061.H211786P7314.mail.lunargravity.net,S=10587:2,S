<html><div style='background-color:'><DIV>Apparently 7-11 are the new guarantors of peace and prosperity in the world.&nbsp; This was news to me as, at just after 1am, my thai taxi driver swerved in and out of the imaginary traffic from the airport through a seemingly endless maze of twisting and cluttered roadways on my way to an unknown guest house.&nbsp; "You have never been to Bangkok before," he declared to no one in particular, facing out the open window rather than&nbsp;towards me as if I smelled a little off.&nbsp; "You should not worry," he&nbsp;continued,&nbsp;"very safe.&nbsp; 7-11 everywhere. Open 24 hours!"&nbsp; At which point he proceeded to dump me unceremoniously&nbsp;at an unknown curb on an unknown street in an unknown neighbourhood in that unknown city.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I looked around with some trepidation, but was relieved to see that the taxi man had left me beside not just one, but in fact two&nbsp;protective 7-11 stores.&nbsp; And&nbsp;so with&nbsp;his reassurances ringing in my ears,&nbsp;fortified by the familiar neon signs&nbsp;glowing serenly in the tropical darkness,&nbsp;I wandered alone down the&nbsp;unlit alley&nbsp;before me (bearing a small sign declaring "backpackers haven") in search of a bed for the remainder of the night.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I was led upsatirs in the airy&nbsp;Tavee Lodge by a resigned looking woman roused from her sleep on a barstool in the&nbsp;entryway (as if she had been waiting for me).&nbsp; It took me a moment of disorientation once I stepped into my room to realize that the powerful sense of deja vu&nbsp;I was experiencing was just leftovers from having recently watched the movie "The Beach".&nbsp; I swear the scene&nbsp;near the beginning in which the guy kills himself graphically in the room of the guesthouse could have been shot right where I was standing.&nbsp; Minus the blood and stuff, of course.&nbsp; Despite it feeling like 4 am to my travel weary body, it took me a long time to go to sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Which is why I was a little perplexed the next morning to find myself wide awake before 6 am.&nbsp; Thinking that the Korean embassy would probably open around 8, and mindful of the fact that the sooner I got my visa problems taken care of there the sooner I could relax and enjoy my impromptu vacation, I decided just to get up and get on with day.&nbsp; I ate a bit of breakfast downstairs, plotted and abandoned several bus/train/boat routes before deciding just to pay for a cab to the embassy, and sent out documents in hand.&nbsp; This sounds like a much better plan than it really was.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>For starters, the cab driver was just as baffled by the address of the embassy as I was.&nbsp; This fact he tried to hide by touring me around a wide swathe of the city over and over again looking perplexedly at the map I had helpfully brought along rather than at the swiftly moving traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp;After several frighteningly near missed with an array of motor vehicles so diverse I had not even&nbsp;imagined some of them before, he&nbsp;gave up looking&nbsp;and pulled into one of the largest hotels in town.  I think&nbsp;he had hoped&nbsp;to abandon me there.&nbsp; A crisply uniformed man rushed out of the lobby to ask me what the problem was, however, and a little to my dismay convinced the taxi&nbsp;driver that it really was an easy place to find and gave him directions there.&nbsp; In the taxi I stayed, and off we went into the chaotic streets once again.&nbsp; To&nbsp;the&nbsp;driver's credit, he did eventually get me to within a&nbsp;ten or so minute walk of the embassy.&nbsp; Although I think he might have been a little more helpful considering the by-then enormous fare in not forcing me out behind the armed guard of a private Thai government complex...</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I finally found the embassy, on foot, nearing 10am.&nbsp; I walked purposefully up to the security checkpoint, passport and Korean residency card in hand, practiced Korean words eager on my tongue.&nbsp; Only to be faced with a bored looking Thai man who spoke neither Korean nor English.&nbsp; This was a problem I had not foreseen.&nbsp; After much gesturing and handing over of papers, he finally just pointed to a tiny sign on the door&nbsp;behind him which read "visa application, 1:30-3:30".&nbsp; I tried to explain that I didn't need to apply - the paper in my hand was the visa authorization.&nbsp; He pointed at the sign again and shut the window.&nbsp; Clearly, our conversation was over.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Being a little reluctant to show my face to the guards at the government building again, the only other building of consequence in the neighbourhood, I decided to take a taxi to one of the Bangkok sights while I was waiting on the embassy.&nbsp; Choosing the most well known and centrally located attraction on the map (The Grand Palace), and writing it out in Thai, I didn't think I could go wrong.&nbsp; After the first taxi fiasco of the day, you'd think I'd have known better.&nbsp; Alas, 1 hour and many wrong turns later I finally found myself not at the Grand Palace, but instead at the largest teak-wood mansion in the world (ie. a giant, moldy, wooden house full of random, moldy, historical stuff).&nbsp; Approximately 2 blocks away from the guest house where I started the day.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I managed to get back to the embassy&nbsp;not only on time, but in a remarkably short period after my wander through the accumulated historical dust and wood-polish of the mansion.&nbsp; Just in time to be told by the lady behind the counter inside that I had failed to bring a very important form with me.&nbsp; I would have to leave and complete it, she said.&nbsp; I sighed, but did so without complaining.&nbsp; When I brought it back to her, she informed me that they only accepted that form between 10-11am and that I would have to come back the next day during those hours.&nbsp; I wondered&nbsp;briefly whose laws I would be prosecuted under if I lost control and, say, forgot to bow respectfully to&nbsp;her on my way out or something, but I controlled myself and the international incident was avoided.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The next morning I arrived at the gate precisely at 10, determined to relax and enjoy the absurdity of the situation as part of the fun of my foreign adventure.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2 hour thai massage&nbsp;from the night before helped me to stay focussed on this goal.&nbsp; Until the same lady from the day before informed me that&nbsp;although the form in hand could only be dropped off at 10am,&nbsp;the actual visa office was only available between 1:30 and 3:30&nbsp;to consider my petition, so I would need to come back then.&nbsp; Preferably with wads of cash to smooth the transition (she put it somewhat more dimplomatically, but that was the jist of it).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>At 1:30 I joined the milling crowd again in line at the embassy counter.&nbsp; And with the rest of the crowd I was directed to a line of chairs in front of an ominous looking door marked "interrogations".&nbsp; Several people disappeared behind this door and failed to return.&nbsp; People were getting anxious.&nbsp; I wondered exactly what a Korean interrogation was like, and if I would also be subjected to one as it seemed everyone else in the waiting room was.&nbsp; But just when I was thoroughly convinced that I would never actually get to see any of&nbsp;the country I was in outside of the&nbsp;embassy walls (which are in fact part of Korea and not of Thailand at all),&nbsp;THE lady called me up in a pleasant voice, took my wad of cash and handed me my new visa.&nbsp; It was exactly 3:30.&nbsp; I could see that her fingernails were freshly polished and wondered&nbsp;if she had just been waiting for the clock to tick over.&nbsp; No matter - I was free!&nbsp; I bowed deeply, thanked her in a stilted combination of English, Korean and Thai, and made my way&nbsp;outside&nbsp;into the&nbsp;infinite possibilites of a whole new country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </DIV></div><br clear=all><hr>The new  <a href="http://g.msn.com/8HMBENCA/2737??PS=">MSN 8: </a> smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*  </html>
