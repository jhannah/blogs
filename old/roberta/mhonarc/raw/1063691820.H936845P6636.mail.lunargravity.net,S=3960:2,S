<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Life in Changwon is picking up in wake of the massive typhoon that hit Friday.&nbsp; They say it&nbsp;was the worst storm hit here&nbsp; in a century, and I am just as happy to have missed that particular excitement.&nbsp; There is quite a bit of damage around town, although luckily here most of it is superficial (trees blown down, windows broken, signs mangled etc.).&nbsp; My own home was not affected at all.&nbsp; Our neighbouring city was not so lucky - they are on the ocean side and suffered much more serious damage.&nbsp; Over 100 people were killed, businesses ruined, homes demolished - the government has just declared it a national disaster zone and is flying in relief supplies and troops to help patch things up.&nbsp; One good thing - it's been cool to see everyone out in the streets together helping to clean things up, and a good way to meet people while helping out.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>My first class went much better than I expected.&nbsp; There are only 10 students, 8 of&nbsp;whom have far better English skills than I had&nbsp;hoped for, and they are all eager to jump right in and learn.&nbsp; It looks to be an interesting and fun class to teach, and has me pretty psyched about being here.&nbsp; The rest of my classes are all at the end of the week, so hopefully they will go as well.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Lunch is calling my name, so I&nbsp;should call back.&nbsp; I hope you are all having great days wherever you are!&nbsp; Much love - Roberta&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </DIV></div><br clear=all><hr>Help STOP SPAM with  <a href="http://g.msn.com/8HMLENCA/2731??PS=">the new MSN 8 </a> and get 2 months FREE*</html>
