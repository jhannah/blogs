This talk was awesome! [Putting the ideas together, a hands on tutorial of modern Perl](http://act.yapcna.org/2012/talk/70). Big kudos to Jacinta Richardson. I'm going to hijack [ODLUG](http://odlug.org) meetings for months to come with these materials. :)

Download their 71 page .pdf off their talk page. It's a great resource. Table of contents:

1. About Perl Training Australia
2. Installing from the CPAN
3. Packaging and unpacking with PAR
4. autodie - The art of Klingon Programming
5. Everythingâ€™s an object with autobox
6. Building complex expressions
7. Practical Exercises
8. Devel::NYTProf - Code profiling in the 21st century
9. Using Perl::Critic to automatically review your code
10. Object Oriented Programming with Moose
11. Testing your module

Incidentally, here's the 5 minute one-liner I wrote for the exercise on page 21:

    perl -Mautobox::Core -E 'my $j = int(rand(100)); while (<>) { chomp; \
       if ($_ == $j) { say "you win!"; exit }  say $_ > $j ? 'lower' : 'higher'}'

It works, but completely fails to actually **use** `autobox::Core`, which was the original point. Oops. :)
